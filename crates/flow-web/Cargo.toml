# Tell `rustc` to optimize for small code size.

# Also optimize for small code size when building dev/test code. This
# regretably slows things down, but it works around some potential pitfalls
# with the default `opt-level = 0`, which can produce WASM functions with more
# than 50k local variables, which seems to be a common limit. We could probably
# get away with using `opt-level = 1`, if this is too slow, but I kept it
# consistent with the release profile for now.
