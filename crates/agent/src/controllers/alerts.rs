/// seen a use case for doing that with any of the alerts we have so far.
/// I tried to leave open the possibility that we could use that portion of the
/// API if we needed to, but didn't want to add the complexity to the controller
/// code unless it actually became necessary. If we end up needing to provide
/// separate `resolved_arguments` for an alert, that can be done by leaving the
/// alert status in place and updating the `state` to `Resolved` (and then scheduling
/// a subsequent removal of the alert from `statuses` some time in the future).
