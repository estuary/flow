// TODO(johnny): We are *very* close to being able to define merge()
// in terms of a trivial Shape::union(). The one reason we cannot,
// is because we would have to mark object shapes with additionalProperties: false,
// which is definitely something we should do but not until we have a tight
// feedback / re-publication cycle around inferred-schema violations.
//
// See comment on infer_object_shape()
//
// For now, the difference between merge() and union() is that merge
// does not prune properties present in one schema but not the other,
// where the other schema does not specifically restrict that property
// from existing. merge() also doesn't handle a slew of cases that
// union() *does* handle, and we should seek to remove it.
