# Control-plane-api

All of the sources in this crate were generated by `openapi-generator` using the command:

`openapi-generator -i <control-plane-openapi-spec.json> -g rust -o . --additional-properties library=reqwest-trait`

The openapi spec was downloaded from a running agent instance.
I think this is probably not worth using.
