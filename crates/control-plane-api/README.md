# control-plane-api

## Development

> **NOTE:** All commands below should be run from inside the Lima VM.

### Applying Changes

Restart the agent API service to pick up changes:

```bash
systemctl --user restart flow-control-agent.service
```

### Updating the GraphQL Schema

The auto-generated GraphQL schema is checked into the repo. After making changes to the GraphQL API, regenerate it with:

```bash
cargo build -p flow-client --features generate
```

### Updating sqlx query cache

After adding / modifying SQL queries, regenerate the checked-in sqlx query cache so that offline compilation works:

```bash
cargo sqlx prepare --workspace
```

### Updating test snapshots

Tests use `insta` for snapshot testing. After making changes that affect test output, review and accept updated snapshots with:

```bash
cargo insta review -p control-plane-api
```
