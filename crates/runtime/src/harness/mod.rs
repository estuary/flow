// Routines for building test harness of captures, derivations,

// shape:
// * `sessions` is the number of times the underlying connector should be re-opened,
//    exercising state & checkpoint recovery and resumption, and the target number
//    of transactions for each session.
// * `delay` is artificial delay added between transactions, simulating back-pressure.
// * `timeout` is how long the task may produce no data before its current session ends,
//    though a next may then start.
