  // Transactions is a very long lived RPC through which the Flow runtime and a
  // Driver cooperatively execute an unbounded number of transactions.
  //
  // This RPC workflow maintains a materialized view of a Flow collection
  // in an external system. It has distinct load, prepare, store, and commit
  // phases. The Flow runtime and driver cooperatively maintain a fully-reduced
  // view of each document by loading current states from the store, reducing in
  // a number of updates, and then transactionally storing updated documents and
  // checkpoints.
  //
  // Push-only Endpoints & Delta Updates
  // ===================================
  //
  // Some systems, such as APIs, Webhooks, and Pub/Sub, are push-only in nature.
  // Flow materializations can run in a "delta updates" mode, where the load
  // phase is always skipped and Flow does not attempt to store fully-reduced
  // documents. Instead, during the store phase, the runtime sends delta
  // updates which reflect the combined roll-up of collection documents
  // processed only within this transaction.
  //
  // To illustrate the meaning of a delta update, consider documents which are
  // simple counters, having a collection schema that uses a `sum` reduction
  // strategy.
  //
  // Without delta updates, Flow would reduce documents -1, 3, and 2 by `sum`
  // to arrive at document 4, which is stored. The next transaction,
  // document 4 is loaded and reduced with 6, -7, and -1 to arrive at a new
  // stored document 2. This document, 2, represents the full reduction of the
  // collection documents materialized thus far.
  //
  // Compare to delta updates mode: collection documents -1, 3, and 2 are
  // combined to store a delta-update document of 4. The next transaction starts
  // anew, and 6, -7, and -1 combine to arrive at a delta-update document of -2.
  // These delta updates are a windowed combine over documents seen in the
  // current transaction only, and unlike before are not a full reduction of the
  // document. If delta updates were written to pub/sub, note that a subscriber
  // could further reduce over each delta update to recover the fully reduced
  // document of 2.
  //
  // Note that many use cases require only `lastWriteWins` reduction behavior,
  // and for these use cases delta updates does the "right thing" by trivially
  // re-writing each document with its most recent version. This matches the
  // behavior of Kafka Connect, for example.
  //
  // On Transactionality
  // ===================
  //
  // The beating heart of transactionality in materializations is this:
  // there is a consumption checkpoint, and there is a state of the view.
  // As the materialization progresses, both the checkpoint and the view state
  // will change. Updates to the checkpoint and to the view state MUST always
  // commit together, in the exact same transaction.
  //
  // Flow transaction tasks have a backing transactional recovery log,
  // which is capable of durable commits that update both the checkpoint
  // and also a (reasonably small) driver-defined state. More on driver
  // states later.
  //
  // Many interesting systems are also fully transactional in nature.
  //
  // When implementing a matherialization driver, the first question an
  // implementor must answer is: whose commit is authoritative?
  // Flow's recovery log, or the materialized system ?
  // This protocol supports either.
  //
  // Implementation Pattern: Remote Store is Authoritative
  // =====================================================
  //
  // In this pattern, the remote store persists view states and the Flow
  // consumption checkpoints which those views reflect (there are many such
  // checkpoints: one per task split). The Flow recovery log is not used.
  //
  // Typically this workflow runs in the context of a synchronous BEGIN/COMMIT
  // transaction, which updates table states and a Flow checkpoint together.
  // The transaction need be scoped only to the store phase of this workflow,
  // as the Flow runtime assumes only read-committed loads.
  //
  // Flow is a distributed system, and an important consideration is the effect
  // of a "zombie" assignment of a materialization task, which can race a
  // newly-promoted assignment of that same task.
  //
  // Fencing is a technique which uses the transactional capabilities of a store
  // to "fence off" an older zombie assignment, such that it's prevented from
  // committing further transactions. This avoids a failure mode where:
  //  - New assignment N recovers a checkpoint at Ti.
  //  - Zombie assignment Z commits another transaction at Ti+1.
  //  - N beings processing from Ti, inadvertently duplicating the effects of
  //  Ti+1.
  //
  // When authoritative, the remote store must implement fencing behavior.
  // As a sketch, the store can maintain a nonce value alongside the checkpoint
  // of each task split. The nonce is updated on each open of this RPC,
  // and each commit transaction then verifies that the nonce has not been
  // changed.
  //
  // In the future, if another RPC opens and updates the nonce, it fences off
  // this instance of the task split and prevents it from committing further
  // transactions.
  //
  // Implementation Pattern: Recovery Log with Non-Transactional Store
  // =================================================================
  //
  // In this pattern, the recovery log persists the Flow checkpoint and handles
  // fencing semantics. During the load and store phases, the driver
  // directly manipulates a non-transactional store or API.
  //
  // Note that this pattern is at-least-once. A transaction may fail part-way
  // through and be restarted, causing its effects to be partially or fully
  // replayed.
  //
  // Care must be taken if the collection's schema has reduction annotations
  // such as `sum`, as those reductions may be applied more than once due to
  // a partially completed, but ultimately failed transaction.
  //
  // If the collection's schema is last-write-wins, this mode still provides
  // effectively-once behavior. Collections which aren't last-write-wins
  // can be turned into last-write-wins through the use of derivation
  // registers.
  //
  // Implementation Pattern: Recovery Log with Idempotent Apply
  // ==========================================================
  //
  // In this pattern the recovery log is authoritative, but the driver uses
  // external stable storage to stage the effects of a transaction -- rather
  // than directly applying them to the store -- such that those effects can be
  // idempotently applied after the transaction commits.
  //
  // This allows stores which feature a weaker transactionality guarantee to
  // still be used in an exactly-once way, so long as they support an idempotent
  // apply operation.
  //
  // Driver checkpoints can facilitate this pattern. For example, a driver might
  // generate a unique filename in S3 and reference it in its prepared
  // checkpoint, which is committed to the recovery log. During the "store"
  // phase, it writes to this S3 file. After the transaction commits, it tells
  // the store of the new file to incorporate. The store must handle
  // idempotency, by applying the effects of the unique file just once, even if
  // told of the file multiple times.
  //
  // A related extension of this pattern is for the driver to embed a Flow
  // checkpoint into its driver checkpoint. Doing so allows the driver to
  // express an intention to restart from an older alternative checkpoint, as
  // compared to the most recent committed checkpoint of the recovery log.
  //
  // As mentioned above, it's crucial that store states and checkpoints commit
  // together. While seemingly bending that rule, this pattern is consistent
  // with it because, on commit, the semantic contents of the store include BOTH
  // its base state, as well as the staged idempotent update. The store just may
  // not know it yet, but eventually it must because of the retried idempotent
  // apply.
  //
  // Note the driver must therefore ensure that staged updates are fully applied
  // before returning an "load" responses, in order to provide the correct
  // read-committed semantics required by the Flow runtime.
  //
  // RPC Lifecycle
  // =============
  //
  // The RPC follows the following lifecycle:
  //
  // :TransactionRequest.Open:
  //    - The Flow runtime opens the stream.
  // :TransactionResponse.Opened:
  //    - If the remote store is authoritative, it must fence off other RPCs
  //      of this task split from committing further transactions,
  //      and it retrieves a Flow checkpoint which is returned to the runtime.
  //
  // TransactionRequest.Open and TransactionResponse.Opened are sent only
  // once, at the commencement of the stream. Thereafter the protocol loops:
  //
  // Load phase
  // ==========
  //
  // The Load phases is Load requests *intermixed* with one
  // Acknowledge/Acknowledged message flow. The driver must accomodate an
  // Acknowledge that occurs before, during, or after a sequence of Load
  // requests. It's guaranteed to see exactly one Acknowledge request during
  // this phase.
  //
  // :TransactionRequest.Acknowledge:
  //    - The runtime tells the driver that a commit to the recovery log has
  //      completed.
  //    - The driver applies a staged update to the base store, where
  //      applicable.
  //    - Note Acknowledge is sent in the very first iteration for consistency.
  //      Semantically, it's an acknowledgement of the recovered checkpoint.
  //      If a previous invocation failed after recovery log commit but before
  //      applying the staged change, this is an opportunity to ensure that
  //      apply occurs.
  // :TransactionResponse.Acknowledged:
  //    - The driver responds to the runtime only after applying a staged
  //      update, where applicable.
  //    - If there is no staged update, the driver immediately responds on
  //      seeing Acknowledge.
  //
  // :TransactionRequest.Load:
  //    - The runtime sends zero or more Load messages.
  //    - The driver may send any number of TransactionResponse.Loaded in
  //      response.
  //    - If the driver will apply a staged update, it must await Acknowledge
  //      and have applied the update to the store *before* evaluating any
  //      Loads, to ensure correct read-committed behavior.
  //    - The driver may defer responding with some or all loads until the
  //      prepare phase.
  // :TransactionResponse.Loaded:
  //    - The driver sends zero or more Loaded messages, once for each loaded
  //      document.
  //    - Document keys not found in the store are omitted and not sent as
  //      Loaded.
  //
  // Prepare phase
  // =============
  //
  // The prepare phase begins only after the prior transaction has both
  // committed and also been acknowledged. It marks the bounds of the present
  // transaction.
  //
  // Upon entering this phase, the driver must immediately evaluate any deferred
  // Load requests and send remaining Loaded responses.
  //
  // :TransactionRequest.Prepare:
  //    - The runtime sends a Prepare message with its Flow checkpoint.
  // :TransactionResponse.Prepared:
  //    - The driver sends Prepared after having flushed all Loaded responses.
  //    - The driver may include a driver checkpoint update which will be
  //      committed to the recovery log with this transaction.
  //
  // Store phase
  // ===========
  //
  // The store phase is when the runtime sends the driver materialized document
  // updates, as well as an indication of whether the document is an insert,
  // update, or delete (in other words, was it returned in a Loaded response?).
  //
  // :TransactionRequest.Store:
  //    - The runtime sends zero or more Store messages.
  //
  // Commit phase
  // ============
  //
  // The commit phase marks the end of the store phase, and tells the driver of
  // the runtime's intent to commit to its recovery log. If the remote store is
  // authoritative, the driver must commit its transaction at this time.
  //
  // :TransactionRequest.Commit:
  //    - The runtime sends a Commit message, denoting its intention to commit.
  //    - If the remote store is authoritative, the driver includes the Flow
  //      checkpoint into its transaction and commits it along with view state
  //      updates.
  //    - Otherwise, the driver immediately responds with DriverCommitted.
  // :TransactionResponse.DriverCommitted:
  //    - The driver sends a DriverCommitted message.
  //    - The runtime commits Flow and driver checkpoint to its recovery
  //      log. The completion of this commit will be marked by an
  //      Acknowledge during the next load phase.
  //    - Runtime and driver begin a new, pipelined transaction by looping to
  //      load while this transaction continues to commit.
  //
  // An error of any kind rolls back the transaction in progress and terminates
  // the stream.
