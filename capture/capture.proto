  // Pull is a very long lived RPC through which the Flow runtime and a
  // Driver cooperatively execute an unbounded number of transactions.
  //
  // The Pull workflow pulls streams of documents into capturing Flow
  // collections. Streams are incremental and resume-able, with resumption
  // semantics defined by the driver. The Flow Runtime uses a transactional
  // recovery log to support this workflow, and the driver may persist arbitrary
  // driver checkpoints into that log as part of the RPC lifecycle,
  // to power its chosen resumption semantics.
  //
  // Pull tasks are split-able, and many concurrent invocations of the RPC
  // may collectively capture from a source, where each task split has an
  // identified range of keys it's responsible for. The meaning of a "key",
  // and it's application within the remote store being captured from, is up
  // to the driver. The driver might map partitions or shards into the keyspace,
  // and from there to a covering task split. Or, it might map distinct files,
  // or some other unit of scaling.
  //
  // RPC Lifecycle
  // =============
  //
  // :PullRequest.Open:
  //    - The Flow runtime opens the pull stream.
  // :PullResponse.Opened:
  //    - The driver responds with Opened.
  //
  // PullRequest.Open and PullRequest.Opened are sent only once, at the
  // commencement of the stream. Thereafter the protocol loops:
  //
  // :PullResponse.Documents:
  //    - The driver tells the runtime of some documents, which are pending a
  //      future Checkpoint.
  //    - If the driver sends multiple Documents messages without an
  //      interleaving Checkpoint, the Flow runtime MUST commit
  //      documents of all such messages in a single transaction.
  // :PullResponse.Checkpoint:
  //    - The driver tells the runtime of a checkpoint: a watermark in the
  //      captured documents stream which is eligble to be used as a
  //      transaction commit boundary.
  //    - Whether the checkpoint becomes a commit boundary is at the
  //      discretion of the Flow runtime. It may combine multiple checkpoints
  //      into a single transaction.
  // :PullRequest.Acknowledge:
  //    - The Flow runtime tells the driver that its Checkpoint has committed.
  //    - The runtime sends one ordered Acknowledge for each Checkpoint.
  //

  // and a driver cooperatively execute an unbounded number of transactions.

  // The Push workflow pushes streams of documents into capturing Flow
  // collections. The driver is responsible for initiation and resumption of
  // push streams. The Flow runtime uses a transactional recovery log to support
  // this workflow, and the driver may persist arbitrary driver checkpoints into
  // that log as part of the RPC lifecycle, to power its chosen resumption
  // semantics.
  //
  // A push RPC is evaluated against a specific task shard split, which is
  // encoded in the PushRequest.Open.Header. A driver may perform its own load
  // balancing by obtain a shard listing and embedding a selected shard into
  // that header. Or, it may leave it empty and an arbitary shard will be
  // randomly chosen for it.
  //
  // RPC Lifecycle
  // =============
  //
  // :PushRequest.Open:
  //    - The driver opens the push stream, naming its capture and
  //      optional routing header.
  // :PushResponse.Opened:
  //    - The Flow runtime responds with Opened, which tells the driver
  //      of the specific CaptureSpec and [key_begin, key_end] range of
  //      this RPC, as well as the last driver checkpoint.
  //    - The semantics and treatment of the key range is up to the driver.
