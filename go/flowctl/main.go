Inspect a configured endpoint, and generate a Flow catalog of collections,
schemas, and capture bindings which reflect its available resources.

Discover is a two-stage workflow:

In the first invocation, the command will generate a stub
configuration YAML derived from the connector's specification.
The user reviews this YAML file, and updates it with appropriate
credentials and configuration.

In the second invocation, the command applies the completed
configuration to the endpoint and determines its available resource
bindings. It generates a Flow catalog YAML file with a Flow Capture
and associated Collection definitions. The user may then review,
update, refactor, and otherwise incorporate the generated entities
into their broader Flow catalog.
