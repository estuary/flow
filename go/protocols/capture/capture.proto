// Captures is a very long lived RPC through which the Flow runtime and a
// connector cooperatively execute an unbounded number of transactions.
//
// The Pull workflow pulls streams of documents into capturing Flow
// collections. Streams are incremental and resume-able, with resumption
// semantics defined by the connector. The Flow Runtime uses a transactional
// recovery log to support this workflow, and the connector may persist arbitrary
// driver checkpoints into that log as part of the RPC lifecycle,
// to power its chosen resumption semantics.
//
// Pull tasks are split-able, and many concurrent invocations of the RPC
// may collectively capture from a source, where each task split has an
// identified range of keys it's responsible for. The meaning of a "key",
// and it's application within the remote store being captured from, is up
// to the connector. The connector might map partitions or shards into the keyspace,
// and from there to a covering task split. Or, it might map distinct files,
// or some other unit of scaling.
//
// RPC Lifecycle
// =============
//
// :Request.Open:
//    - The Flow runtime opens the pull stream.
// :Response.Opened:
//    - The connector responds with Opened.
//
// Request.Open and Request.Opened are sent only once, at the
// commencement of the stream. Thereafter the protocol loops:
//
// :Response.Captured:
//    - The connector tells the runtime of documents,
//      which are pending a future Checkpoint.
//    - If the connector sends multiple Documents messages without an
//      interleaving Checkpoint, the Flow runtime MUST commit
//      documents of all such messages in a single transaction.
// :Response.Checkpoint:
//    - The connector tells the runtime of a checkpoint: a watermark in the
//      captured documents stream which is eligible to be used as a
//      transaction commit boundary.
//    - Whether the checkpoint becomes a commit boundary is at the
//      discretion of the Flow runtime. It may combine multiple checkpoints
//      into a single transaction.
// :Request.Acknowledge:
//    - The Flow runtime tells the connector that its Checkpoint has committed.
//    - The runtime sends one ordered Acknowledge for each Checkpoint.
