  // Transactions is a very long lived RPC through which the Flow runtime and a

  //      opening the stream and requesting it be fenced from other streams.
  // :Opened:
  //    - The driver server sends TransactionResponse.Opened after,
  //      where supported, ensuring other stream clients are fenced.
  //
  // TransactionRequest.Open and TransactionResponse.Opened are sent only
  // once, at the commencement of the stream. Thereafter the protocol loops:
  //
  // :Load:
  //    - The client sends zero or more TransactionRequest.Load.
  //    - The driver server may immediately send any number of
  //      TransactionResponse.Loaded in response.
  //    - Or, it may defer responding with some or all loads until later.
  // :Prepare:
  //    - The client sends TransactionRequest.Prepare.
  //    - At this time, the server must flush remaining
  //      TransactionResponse.Loaded.
  // :Prepared:
  //    - The server sends TransactionResponse.Prepared.
  // :Store:
  //    - The client sends zero or more TransactionRequest.Store.
  // :Commit:
  //    - The client sends TransactionRequest.Commit.
  //    - The server commits the prepared Flow checkpoint and all stores.
  // :Committed:
  //    - The server sends TransactionResponse.Committed.
  //    - The Flow runtime persists the prepared driver checkpoint.
  //    - Client and server begin a new transaction and loop to "Load".
