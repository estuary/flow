type Transactor interface {
	// Load implements the transaction load phase by consuming Load requests
	// from the LoadIterator and calling the provided `loaded` callback.
	// Load can ignore keys which are not found in the store, and it may
	// defer calls to `loaded` for as long as it wishes, so long as `loaded`
	// is called for every found document prior to returning.
	//
	// If this Transactor chooses to uses concurrency in StartCommit, note
	// that Load may be called while the OpFuture returned by StartCommit
	// is still running. However, absent an error, LoadIterator.Next() will
	// not return false until that OpFuture has resolved.
	//
	// Typically a Transactor that chooses to use concurrency should "stage"
	// loads for later evaluation, and then evaluate all loads upon that
	// commit resolving, or even wait until Next() returns false.
	//
	// Waiting for the prior commit ensures that evaluated loads reflect the
	// updates of that prior transaction, and thus meet the formal "read-committed"
	// guarantee required by the runtime.

	// Store consumes Store requests from the StoreIterator and returns
	// a StartCommitFunc which is used to commit the stored transaction.
	// StartCommitFunc may be nil, which indicate that commits are a

	// doesn't use a ConnectorState checkpoint.

// StartCommitFunc begins to commit a stored transaction.
// Upon its return a commit operation may still be running in the background,
// and the returned OpFuture must resolve with its completion.
// (Upon its resolution, Acknowledged will be sent to the Runtime).
//
// # When using the "Remote Store is Authoritative" pattern:
//
// StartCommitFunc must include `runtimeCheckpoint` within its endpoint
// transaction and either immediately or asynchronously commit.
// If the Transactor commits synchronously, it may return a nil OpFuture.
//
// # When using the "Recovery Log is Authoritative with Idempotent Apply" pattern:
//
// StartCommitFunc must return a ConnectorState checkpoint which encodes the staged
// application. It must begin an asynchronous application of this staged
// update, immediately returning its OpFuture.
//
// That async application MUST await a future signal of `runtimeAckCh`
// before taking action, however, to ensure that the ConnectorState returned
// by StartCommit has been durably committed to the runtime recovery log.
// `runtimeAckCh` is closed when an Acknowledge request is received from
// the runtime, indicating that the transaction and its ConnectorState
// have been committed to the runtime recovery log.
//
// Note it's possible that the ConnectorState may commit to the log,
// but then the runtime or this Transactor may crash before the application
// is able to complete. For this reason, on initialization a Transactor must
// take care to (re-)apply a staged update in the opened ConnectorState.
//
// If StartCommitFunc fails, it should return a pre-resolved OpFuture
// which carries its error (for example, via FinishedOperation()).
