# Derivation Patterns

## Where to accumulate?

When building a derived collection, the central question is where accumulation
will happen: within derivation state, or within an external database that you
materialize into? Both approaches can produce equivalent results, but they do it
in very different ways.

### Accumulate in the external database

To accumulate in the external database, you'll define a collection having a
reducible schema with a stateless derivation. The derivation can be written
in either SQL or Typescript, but for these examples we use Typescript. The
Flow runtime uses the provided annotations to reduce new documents into the
collection, and ultimately keep the materialized table up to date.

A key insight is that the database is the _only_ stateful system in this
scenario, and that Flow is making use of reductions in two places:

1. To combine many published documents into partial "delta" states,
   which are the literal documents written to the collection.
2. To reduce "delta" states into the DB-stored value, reaching a final value.

For example, consider a collection that's summing a value:

| Time | DB    | Lambdas           | Derived Document |
| ---- | ----- | ----------------- | ---------------- |
| T0   | **0** | publish(2, 1, 2)  | **5**            |
| T1   | **5** | publish(-2, 1)    | **-1**           |
| T2   | **4** | publish(3, -2, 1) | **2**            |
| T3   | **6** | publish()         |

This works especially well when materializing into a transactional database.
Flow couples its processing transactions with corresponding DB transactions,
ensuring end-to-end "exactly once" semantics.

When materializing into a non-transactional store, Flow is only able
to provide weaker "at least once" semantics: it's possible that a document
may be combined into a DB value more than once. Whether that's a concern
depends a bit on the task at hand. Some reductions can be applied repeatedly
without changing the result ("idempotent"), and some use cases are fine with
_close enough_. For our counter above, it could give an incorrect result.

When materializing into a pub/sub topic, there _is_ no store to hold final values,
and Flow will publish delta states: each a partial update of the (unknown)
final value.

### Accumulate in derivation state

Accumulating in derivation state involves a `sqlite` derivation having one
or more tables, which are created by `migrations`. These tables can be shared
and updated by the various transforms of the derivation. The Flow runtime
transactionally persists modifications to these tables.

When using a stateful derivation, the typical pattern is to use `INSERT ... ON
CONFLICT ...` to accumulate state in your tables, and then `SELECT` from those
tables to emit the documents.

Returning to our summing example:

| Time | sum table | Lambdas                          | Derived Document |
| ---- | --------- | -------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| T0   | **0**     | update(2, 1, 2), select sum ...  | **5**            |
| T1   | **5**     | update(-2, 1), select sum ...    | **4**            |
| T2   | **4**     | update(3, -2, 1), select sum ... | **6**            |
| T3   | **6**     | update()                         |

Stateful derivations are a great solution for materializations into non-
transactional stores, because the documents they produce can be applied
multiple times without breaking correctness.

They're also well suited for materializations that publish into pub/sub,
as they can produce stand-alone updates of a fully-reduced value.

Additionally, stateful derivations are the best way to perform inner joins and time-windowed joins.

### Example: Summing in a stateless vs a stateful derivation

See [summer.flow.yaml](summer.flow.yaml) for a simple example
of summing counts using both approaches.

## Types of Joins

### Outer Join using a stateless derivation

Example of an outer join, which is reduced within a target database table.
This join is "fully reactive": it updates with either source collection,
and reflects the complete accumulation of their documents on both sides.

The literal documents written to the collection are combined delta states,
reflecting changes on one or both sides of the join. These delta states
are then fully reduced into the database table, and no other storage _but_
the table being materialized into is required.

See [join-outer-flow.yaml](join-outer-flow.yaml).

### Inner Join using a stateful derivation

Example of an inner join, which is reduced within the derivation's registers.
This join is also "fully reactive", updating with either source collection,
and reflects the complete accumulation of their documents on both sides.

The literal documents written to the collection are fully reduced snapshots
of the current join state.

This example _requires_ registers due to the "inner" join requirement,
which dictates that we can't publish anything until _both_ sides of the
join are matched.

See [join-inner.flow.yaml](join-inner.flow.yaml).

### One-sided join using a stateful derivation

Example of a one-sided join, which publishes a current LHS joined
with an accumulated RHS.

This example is _not_ fully reactive. It publishes only on a LHS document,
paired with a reduced snapshot of the RHS accumulator at that time.

See [join-one-sided.flow.yaml](join-one-sided.yaml).

## Entity attribute values

This is a common pattern where you have source data with key-value pairs
relating to a specific entity, and you want to normalize it into a table-like format.
In other words, you want to go from this:

```
{"entity_id": "1", "key": "first_name", "value": "Fred"}
{"entity_id": "1", "key": "last_name", "value": "Flintstone"}
```

to this:

```
{"entity_id": "1", "first_name": "Fred", "last_name": "Flintstone"}
```

This is super easy to do in Flow. The key is to use `reduce: { strategy: merge }`
in the derivation's schema.
