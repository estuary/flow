# This example models a problem that's common to customer registration or login
# workflows, where an application may have interactions with a user that occur
# *before* the user completes a registration / login.
#
# Here, we capture events with on anonymous IDs (e.x. a session cookie),
# and join through a mapping of anonymous <=> stable IDs. As new anonymous IDs
# are used, events are collected within a register and then published once an
# associated stable ID is learned. Thereafter, further anonymous events are
# immediately mapped and published.
