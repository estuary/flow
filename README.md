# Estuary Flow (Preview)

Estuary Flow's mission is to make it easy for companies to build and operate
products and services that revolve around continuous data. With Flow, you:

-   üì∑ **Capture** batch and streaming data sources into _collections_: schematized continuous
    datasets that are represented using regular files of JSON in your cloud storage bucket.
    Collections are designed to directly plug into to your existing tools: Spark, Snowflake,
    BigQuery, and others, keeping your data portable, flexible, and... yours!

-   üåä Declare structured transformations over collections and **materialize** them
    as views into other systems: databases, key/value stores, Webhooks, pub/sub, and more.

    Views are repeatable: they always reflect entire collections, not just ongoing updates.
    Flow back-fills newly declared views from historical data, and then keeps them fresh using
    precise, low-latency updates when new source documents arrive.

## Documentation

-   üìñ [Flow documentation](https://app.gitbook.com/@estuary/s/flow/) (üöß _we're actively building this out_).

-   üßê Many [examples/](examples/) are available in this repo, covering a range of use cases and techniques.

Documentation for an older version of Flow continues to live at https://estuary.readthedocs.io,
until we complete our documentation refresh. Concepts remain the same though many details have changed.

## Just show me the code

Write declarative YAML and [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/):

```YAML
collections:
  # Transfers between accounts, e.x. {id: 123, from: alice, to: bob, amount: 32.50}.
  acmeBank/transfers:
    schema:
      # Inline JSON Schema of collection documents.
      type: object
      properties:
        id: { type: integer }
        from: { type: string }
        to: { type: string }
        amount: { type: number }
      required: [id, from, to, amount]
    key: [/id]

  # Derived balances of each account, e.x. {account: alice, amount: 67.35}.
  acmeBank/balances:
    schema:
      type: object
      properties:
        account: { type: string }
        amount:
          # "reduce" keyword extends JSON Schema with annotated reduction
          # behaviors at document locations.
          reduce: { strategy: sum }
          type: number
      required: [account, amount]
      reduce: { strategy: merge }
    key: [/account]

    derivation:
      transform:
        fromTransfers:
          source: { name: acmeBank/transfers }
          # Update balances from source transfers.
          publish: { lambda: typescript }

endpoints:
  acmeBank/database:
    postgres:
      # docker run --rm -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password -p 5432:5432 postgres -c log_statement=all
      host: localhost
      password: password
      dbname: postgres
      user: postgres
      port: 5432

materializations:
  # Materialize the current balance for each account. Flow creates table:
  # CREATE TABLE "account_balances" (
  #      account TEXT PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
  #      amount  DOUBLE PRECISION NOT NULL,
  #      flow_document JSON NOT NULL
  #);
  - source:
      name: acmeBank/balances
    endpoint:
      name: acmeBank/database
      config: { table: account_balances }

tests:
  Expect that balances update with transfers:
    - ingest:
        collection: acmeBank/transfers
        documents:
          - { id: 1, from: alice, to: bob, amount: 32.50 }
          - { id: 2, from: bob, to: carly, amount: 10.75 }
    - verify:
        collection: acmeBank/balances
        documents:
          - { account: alice, amount: -32.50 }
          - { account: bob, amount: 21.75 }
          - { account: carly, amount: 10.75 }

```

This file `acmeBank.flow.yaml` declares a `{ lambda: typescript }`, so Flow expects a
corresponding TypeScript module `acmeBank.flow.ts` that export its lambda definition:

```TypeScript
import { collections, interfaces, registers } from 'flow/modules';

// `collections`, `interfaces`, and `registers` are generated from your JSON schema.
// Flow will auto-create this module with an implementation stub if it doesn't exist:
// all you have to write is the function body.

export class AcmeBankBalances implements interfaces.AcmeBankBalances {
    fromTransfersPublish(
        source: collections.AcmeBankTransfers,
        _register: registers.AcmeBankBalances, // Registers enable stateful derivations,
        _previous: registers.AcmeBankBalances, // but aren't needed here.
    ): collections.AcmeBankBalances[] {
        return [
            // A transfer removes from the sender and adds to the receiver.
            {account: source.from, amount: -source.amount},
            {account: source.to, amount: source.amount},
        ];
    }
}
```

Lambdas can also be remote HTTP endpoints (e.x. AWS Œª), and our road-map includes
producing OpenAPI specs for type definitions in your language of choice, as well
as support for WASM modules.

## How does it work?

Flow is built upon [Gazette](https://gazette.dev) and is by the Gazette authors.
Logical and physical partitions of collections are implemented as Gazette journals,
and derivations and materializations leverage the Gazette consumer framework to
provide durable register states, exactly-once semantics, high availability,
and dynamic scale-out.

Flow is neither "batch" or "streaming", but unifies these paradigms with its
_collection_ concept. Collections are an unbounded batch dataset -- they're stored as
a structured "data lake" of general-purpose files in cloud storage -- and at the same
time are a millisecond-latency stream of updates. Flow consumes directly from cloud
storage for high-scale reads of history, and seamlessly transitions to low-latency
streaming on reaching the present.

## Is it "production" yet?

Gazette, on which Flow is built, has been operated at large scale (GB/s) for many
years now and is very stable.

Flow itself is winding down from an intense period of research and development.
We're running production pilots now, but it's early. You should expect that Flow
may fail in ways that halt execution of derivations or materializations. There may
be cases where derivations or materialization must be rebuilt due to bugs within Flow.
Loss of ingested source data, however, is very unlikely.

## How fast is it?

It depends on the use case, of course, but... fast. On a modest machine,
we're seeing performance of complex, real-world use cases
[achieve 10K inputs / second](https://github.com/estuary/flow/tree/docs-examples/examples/segment#extras-2-turn-up-the-heat),
where each input involves many downstream derivations and materializations.
We haven't begun any profile-guided optimization work, though, and this is likely to improve.

Flow mixes a variety of architectural techniques to achieve great throughput without adding latency:

-   Optimistic pipelining, using the natural back-pressure of systems to which data is committed.
-   Leveraging `reduce` annotations to group collection documents by-key wherever possible,
    in memory, before writing them out.
-   Co-locating derivation states (_registers_) with derivation compute:
    registers live in an embedded RocksDB that's replicated for durability and machine re-assignment.
    They update in memory and only write out at transaction boundaries.
-   Vectorizing the work done in external and even process-internal RPCs.
-   Marrying the development velocity of Go with the raw performance of Rust, using a zero-copy
    [CGO service channel](https://github.com/estuary/flow/commit/0fc0ff83fc5c58e01a09a053419f811d4460776e).

## How do I try it?

We have a [project template](https://github.com/estuary/flow-template) with a
[VSCode devcontainer](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/devcontainerjson-reference)
to jump off from. If you have early access to
[GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces)
you can try it right from your browser.

A Docker image of the development branch is also available as `quay.io/estuary/flow:dev`.
We'll start more regular releases soon, but not quite yet.

You interact with Flow through the `flowctl` CLI tool:

-   `flowctl test` runs all tests of a `--source` catalog.
-   `flowctl develop` starts the Flow runtime around a `--source` catalog, miniaturized to a single local process.
-   `flowctl run` joins, and `flowctl apply` updates, a small-scale production cluster.

Estuary also provides a fully managed offering of Flow, running in your Kubernetes cluster.
Please [reach out](https://estuary.dev/contact) to us for details.
