# This script can be used to start a complete local Flow instance. This includes:
#
# - ui (via npm start, so it auto-rebuilds)
# - control-plane (supabase, including postgres)
# - agent
# - temp-data-plane (includes etcd, gazette broker, and flow reactor)
# - data-plane-gateway
# - oauth edge function
#
# It does this by launching a tmux session with a window for each of the above components.
# If you're not familiar with tmux, I recommend
# [this intro+cheatsheet](https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/tmux-beginners-guide-and-cheat-sheet/)
#
# You need to have all of these repositories checked out locally in order for this to work:
# flow, ui, data-plane-gateway

# This script will start the tmux session and create a window for each component. The starting of
# each component is handled by start-component.sh. That script needs to find where you have those
# repositories checked out. If they're all checked out under their default names and in the same
# parent directory, then everything should "just work". If not, then see start_component.sh for how
# to deal with that.
