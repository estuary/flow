comment on table directives is '
Directives are scoped operations that users may elect to apply.
For example, a directive might grant access to a specific catalog namespace,
or provision the setup of a new organization.

In general these operations require administrative priviledge that the user
does not directly have. The directive mechanism thus enables a user to have a
priviledged operation be applied on their behalf in a self-service fashion.

The types of operations supported by directives are open ended,
but each generally has a well-defined (but parameterizable) scope,
and may also be subject to additional server-side verification checks.

To apply a given directive a user must know its current token, which is
a secret credential that''s typically exchanged through another channel
(such as Slack, or email). The user then creates a corresponding entry in
applied_directives with accompanying user claims.
';
comment on column directives.catalog_prefix is '
Catalog prefix which contains the directive.

Operations undertaken by a directive are scoped within the catalog prefix,
and a user must admin the named prefix in order to admin its directives.
';
comment on column directives.uses_remaining is '
The maximum number of times that this directive may be applied.
This value gets decremented each time the directive is applied.
Once it reaches 0, future attempts to apply the directive will fail.
A null here means that there is no limit.
';
comment on column directives.spec is '
Specification of the directive.

Specification documents must have a string `type` property which defines
the directive type. This type defines the meaning of the remainder of the
specification document.
';
comment on column directives.token is '
Bearer token which is presented by a user to access and apply a directive.

comment on table applied_directives is '
Directives which are being or have been applied by the user.

Users begin to apply a directive by exchanging its bearer token, which creates

parameterize the operation, the directive is validated and applied with the
user''s claims.

comment on function exchange_directive_token is '
exchange_directive_token allows a user to turn in a directive bearer token
and, in exchange, create an application of that directive.

If the supplied token is valid then a new row is created in `applied_directives`.
The user must next update it with their supplied claims.

Having applied a directive through its token, the user is now able to view
the directive. As a convience, this function also returns the directive
along with the newly-created applied_directive row.
