comment on table directives is '
Directives are scoped operations that users may elect to apply.
For example, a directive might grant access to a specific catalog namespace,
or provision the setup of a new organization.

In general these operations require administrative priviledge that the user
does not directly have. The directive mechanism thus enables a user to have a
priviledged operation be applied on their behalf in a self-service fashion.

The types of operations supported by directives are open ended,
but each generally has a well-defined (but parameterizable) scope,
and may also be subject to additional server-side verification checks.

To apply a given directive a user must know its current token, which is
a secret credential that''s typically exchanged through another channel
(such as Slack, or email). The user then creates a corresponding entry in
applied_directives with accompanying user claims.
';
comment on column directives.catalog_prefix is '
Catalog prefix which contains the directive.

Operations undertaken by a directive are scoped within the catalog prefix,
and a user must admin the named prefix in order to admin its directives.
';
comment on column directives.single_use is '
Single-use directives have their token disabled after its first use.
';
comment on column directives.spec is '
Specification of the directive.

Specification documents must have a string `type` property which defines
the directive type. This type defines the meaning of the remainder of the
specification document.
';
comment on column directives.token is '
Bearer token which is presented by a user to access and apply a directive.

Directives which are being or have been applied by the user.

comment on function exchange_directive_token is '
exchange_directive_token allows a user to turn in a directive bearer token
and, in exchange, create an application of that directive.

If the supplied token is valid then a new row is created in `applied_directives`.
The user must next update it with their supplied claims.

Having applied a directive through its token, the user is now able to view
the directive. As a convience, this function also returns the directive
along with the newly-created applied_directive row.
