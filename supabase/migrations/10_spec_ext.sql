/*
This source contains extended metadata views for a number of tables.
We adopt a convention of always naming these tables `${table}_ext`,
and including all columns of the base table with their original names.

IMPORTANT: Do NOT "grant select" on views. Instead change the owner to `authenticated`.
Reason: when created, views are owned by the "postgres" user, to which
row-level security policies don't apply. "grant select" then grants to
`authenticated` the same access that "postgres" has. Changing the owner to
`authenticated` causes the view to be evaluated under their RLS policies.
