Draft specifications may be drawn from a current live specification,
and in this case it''s recommended that expect_pub_id is also set to the
last_pub_id of that inititializing live specification.

Or if there isn''t expected to be a live specification then
expect_pub_id can be the set to an explicit value of ''00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00''
to represent that no live specification is expected to exist.

Then when this draft is published, the publication will fail if the now-current
live specification has a different last_pub_id. This prevents inadvertent errors
where two users attempt to modify or create a catalog specification at the same time,
as the second user publication will fail rather than silently overwriting changes
made by the first user.

When NULL, expect_pub_id has no effect.

comment on column draft_specs.spec is '
Spec is a serialized catalog specification. Its schema depends on its spec_type:
either CollectionDef, CaptureDef, MaterializationDef, DerivationDef,
or an array of TestStep from the Flow catalog schema.

It may also be NULL, in which case `spec_type` must also be NULL
and the specification will be deleted when this draft is published.
