comment on type grant_capability is '
grant_capability is an ordered enumeration of grant capabilities
bestowed upon a grantee by a grantor. Higher enumerated values
imply all of the capabilities of lower enum values.

Enum values beginning with "x_" are placeholders for possible
future extension of the set of granted capabilities.

A "read" capability allows a user or catalog specifications to
read from collections.

A "write" capability allows a user or catalog specification to
write data into collections.

The "admin" capability allows for creating, updating, and deleting
specifications. Unlike "read" or "write", this capability also recursively
grants the bearer all capabilities of the object_role. Put differently,
a user capable of changing a catalog specification is also granted the
capabilities which that specification itself uses to read and write data.
