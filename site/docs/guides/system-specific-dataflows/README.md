# System-specific Data Flows

The guides in this section cover popular Estuary Flow use cases. Each guide walks you through the process of **capturing** data from a specific source system and **materializing** it to a specific destination.

These are supplemental to the [main guide to create a Data Flow](../create-dataflow.md).
If you don't see your exact Data Flow here, use the main guide and the [connector reference](../../reference/Connectors/)
to mix and match your required source and destination systems.
