# Web Dashboard

Estuary provides a [dashboard](https://dashboard.estuary.dev/) to manage Flow pipelines.

Much of the documentation assumes you will mainly be working within the dashboard.
This section in particular will explore some of the different features and functionality you can find within the UI.

Also see the [web app](/concepts/web-app) concepts page to take a brief tour around the dashboard.

Or, if you'd rather take a more programmatic approach to pipeline management, check out our guides on working with [`flowctl`](/guides/flowctl).
