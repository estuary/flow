# Flow tutorials

:::caution
The commands used to run Flow locally, which are critical in these tutorials, are currently undergoing enhancements at a rapid pace. Due to this pace, not all updates are reflected in the documentation. As we fine-tune the ideal Flow onboarding experience, you may see unexpected behavior when following the steps as written here.

**In the meantime, an up-to-date introductory tutorial can be found** [**on GitHub**](https://github.com/estuary/flow-template).

You can also reach our team via [email](<mailto:info@estuary.dev >).
:::

The Flow tutorials are designed for brand new Flow users to get up and running quickly. All you need to do first is [set up your development environment](../installation.md).

We assume you have some engineering background, but anyone with technical skills should be able to follow along.

The tutorials are in order from basic to advanced, but not all topics are required to successfully use Flow. The first tutorial, [Hello Flow](hello-flow.md), teaches you to build a simple unifying pipeline between a source and a database. If that’s all you need, you can stop there. However, if you want to implement transformations and more complex workflows, you should continue through the other tutorials. This all depends on your goals and your data.

Once you’ve mastered the concepts in the tutorials, you’ll be better equipped to make the most of our conceptual and reference documentation and build more and more advanced data pipelines.
