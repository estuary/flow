# Configuring Cloud Storage for Flow

New Flow accounts are connected to Flow's secure cloud storage bucket to store collection data.
To switch to your own bucket, you will need to:

1. [Choose a data plane](#choose-a-data-plane).

2. Then choose a cloud provider for your storage bucket and complete the setup steps:

   * [Google Cloud Storage](#google-cloud-storage-buckets)

   * [Amazon S3](#amazon-s3-buckets)

   * [Azure Blob Storage](#azure-blob-storage)

3. [Add the bucket](#add-the-bucket) in Estuary.

Once your collections begin to persist data, you can view your storage bucket to confirm that the
bucket is receiving data as expected. This should indicate that your bucket has been set up correctly.

You can also set a [bucket lifecycle policy](../concepts/storage-mappings.md#bucket-lifecycle-policies) to limit
how long collections keep data.
Note that lifecycle policies should be specific to the `collection-data/` sub-directory that Estuary creates,
**not** cover the entire bucket.

## Choose a Data Plane

In Estuary, data planes handle connector tasks and data movement.
While there is one control plane that orchestrates tasks, there are multiple data planes to choose from, even [private data planes](/private-byoc).

Choosing a data plane with the same cloud provider or region as your existing infrastructure can reduce latency
or you can ensure data stays within certain regional bounds for compliance purposes.

Data planes with running tasks must be able to talk to your cloud storage to save collection and recovery data.
You must therefore grant access to your storage bucket to the data plane's **IAM user** or **service account**.

You can find your available data planes and their authentication details from the dashboard:

1. Go to the **Admin** page in the Estuary dashboard and select the [**Settings** tab](https://dashboard.estuary.dev/admin/settings).

2. Scroll down to the **Data Planes** table.

3. Find your desired data plane by the **cloud provider** and **region** listing.
Copy its information for use when setting up your storage bucket permissions:

   * For [GCS buckets](#google-cloud-storage-buckets), copy the **GCP Service Account Email**.

   * For [S3 buckets](#amazon-s3-buckets), copy the **AWS IAM User ARN**.

## Google Cloud Storage buckets

You'll need to grant Estuary Flow access to your GCS bucket.

1. [Create a bucket to use with Flow](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/creating-buckets), if you haven't already.

2. Follow the steps
   to [add a principal to a bucket level policy](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/access-control/using-iam-permissions#bucket-add).
   As you do so:

   - For the principal, enter your data plane's [**GCP Service Account Email**](#choose-a-data-plane).

   - Select the [`roles/storage.admin`](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/access-control/iam-roles) role.

## Amazon S3 buckets

You'll need to grant Estuary Flow access to your S3 bucket.

1. [Create a bucket to use with Flow](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/create-bucket-overview.html),
   if you haven't already.

2. Follow the steps
   to [add a bucket policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/add-bucket-policy.html).
   Use the example policy below, making the following modifications:

   - Replace `YOUR-S3-BUCKET` with the actual name of your bucket.

   - Replace `DATA-PLANE-IAM-ARN` with your data plane's [**AWS IAM User ARN**](#choose-a-data-plane).

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "AllowUsersToAccessObjectsUnderPrefix",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": [
          "DATA-PLANE-IAM-ARN",
          "arn:aws:iam::789740162118:user/flow-aws"
        ]
      },
      "Action": [
        "s3:GetObject",
        "s3:PutObject",
        "s3:DeleteObject"
      ],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::YOUR-S3-BUCKET/*"
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": [
          "DATA-PLANE-IAM-ARN",
          "arn:aws:iam::789740162118:user/flow-aws"
        ]
      },
      "Action": "s3:ListBucket",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::YOUR-S3-BUCKET"
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": [
          "DATA-PLANE-IAM-ARN",
          "arn:aws:iam::789740162118:user/flow-aws"
        ]
      },
      "Action": "s3:GetBucketPolicy",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::YOUR-S3-BUCKET"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Azure Blob Storage

You'll need to grant Estuary Flow access to your storage account and container.
You'll also need to provide some identifying information.

1. [Create an Azure storage account](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-account-create) if you haven't already.

   Make sure your storage account has the `Hierarchical Namespace` option **disabled**.
   During storage account creation, you can review this setting in the **Advanced** tab.
   Under the **Data Lake Storage** section, ensure the hierarchical namespace option is unchecked.

2. Within the storage account, [create an Azure Blob Storage container](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-quickstart-blobs-portal#create-a-container)
   to use with Flow, if you haven't already.

3. Gather the following information. You'll need this when you contact us to complete setup.

    - Your **Azure AD tenant ID**. You can find this in the **Azure Active Directory** page.
      ![Azure AD Tenant ID](https://storage.googleapis.com/estuary-marketing-strapi-uploads/uploads//Azure_AD_Tenant_ID_1b60184837/Azure_AD_Tenant_ID_1b60184837.png)

    - Your **Azure Blob Storage account ID**. You can find this in the **Storage Accounts** page.
      ![Azure Storage Account Name](https://storage.googleapis.com/estuary-marketing-strapi-uploads/uploads//Azure_Storage_Account_Name_82aa30ae17/Azure_Storage_Account_Name_82aa30ae17.png)

    - Your **Azure Blob Storage container ID**. You can find this inside your storage account.
      ![Azure Container ID](https://storage.googleapis.com/estuary-marketing-strapi-uploads/uploads//Azure_Container_ID_1980bbc9f3/Azure_Container_ID_1980bbc9f3.png)

   You'll grant Flow access to your storage resources by connecting to Estuary's
   [Azure application](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/what-is-application-management).

4. Add Estuary's Azure application to your tenant.

import { AzureAuthorizeComponent } from "./azureAuthorize";
import BrowserOnly from "@docusaurus/BrowserOnly";

   <Tabs>
   <TabItem value="GCP US Central-1 Data Plane" default>

    <BrowserOnly>{() => <AzureAuthorizeComponent />}</BrowserOnly>
    <br />

    If you're having trouble using the input field above, you may also modify this OAuth link
    with your Azure tenant ID and paste it directly into your browser:

    ```
    https://login.microsoftonline.com/<YOUR_AZURE_TENANT>/oauth2/authorize?client_id=42cb0c6c-dab0-411f-9c21-16d5a2b1b025&response_type=code&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Feyrcnmuzzyriypdajwdk.supabase.co%2Ffunctions%2Fv1%2Fazure-dpc-oauth&resource_id=https://storage.azure.com
    ```
   </TabItem>
   <TabItem value="AWS EU West-1 Data Plane">
    Add the Estuary EU Application to your Azure tenant using the following link:
    [Add Azure Application To Your Tenant](https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/authorize?client_id=24bedcf9-4b7b-4417-b91b-6cc126b57e20&response_type=code&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Festuary.dev%2F&resource_id=https%3A%2F%2Fstorage.azure.com)

    If you are signed in to multiple Azure tenants, and the above link takes you to the incorrect tenant, you can manually replace 'common' with the desired azure tenant ID in the link:

    ```
    https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/authorize?client_id=24bedcf9-4b7b-4417-b91b-6cc126b57e20&response_type=code&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Festuary.dev%2F&resource_id=https%3A%2F%2Fstorage.azure.com
    ```
   </TabItem>
   </Tabs>

5. Grant the application access to your storage account via the
   [
   `Storage Blob Data Owner`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#storage-blob-data-owner)
   IAM role.

    - Inside your storage account's **Access Control (IAM)** tab, click **Add Role Assignment**.

    - Search for `Storage Blob Data Owner` and select it.

    - On the next page, make sure `User, group, or service principal` is selected, then click **+ Select Members**.

    - You must search for the exact name of the application, otherwise it won't show up.
      - **GCP US Central-1 Data Plane:** `Estuary Storage Mappings Prod`
      - **AWS EU West-1 Data Plane:** `data-plane-aws-eu-west-1-c1.dp.estuary-data.com`

    - Once you've selected the application, finish granting the role.

   For more help, see
   the [Azure docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/role-assignments-portal).

## Add the Bucket

If your bucket is for Google Cloud Storage or AWS S3, you can add it yourself. Once you've finished the above steps,
head to "Admin", "Settings" then "Configure Cloud Storage"
and enter the relevant information there and we'll start to use your bucket for all data going forward.

If your bucket is for Azure, send support@estuary.dev an email with the name of the storage bucket and any other
information you gathered per the steps above.
Let us know whether you want to use this storage bucket to for your whole Flow account, or just a
specific [prefix](../concepts/catalogs.md#namespace).
We'll be in touch when it's done!

## Migrating your existing data to the new storage mapping

Once you've created your new storage mapping, your collections will be updated to pick up the new storage mapping,
so new data will be written there. Existing data from your previous storage mapping is not automatically migrated,
to do so you should backfill all of your captures after configuring a storage mapping. Most tenants will have been
using the estuary-public storage mapping on the Free plan to begin with, which expires data after 20 days. By
backfilling all of your captures you guarantee that even though the data from estuary-public will expire, you’ll
still have a full view of your data available on your new storage mapping.
