# Registration and setup

Estuary Flow is a fully managed web application that also offers a robust CLI.

Flow is currently in public beta beta.

## Get started with the Flow web application

You can get started with a Flow trial by visiting the web application [here](https://go.estuary.dev/dashboard).

As a trial user, you can create one end-to-end Data Flow.
Trial user data is deleted from Flow after 30 days.

To skip the limitations of the trial and begin with an organizational account instead, [contact the Estuary team](mailto:support@estuary.dev).

## Get started with the Flow CLI

After your account has been activated through the [web app](#get-started-with-the-flow-web-application), you can begin to work with your data flows from the command line.
This is not required, but it enables more advanced workflows or might simply be your preference.

Flow has a single binary, **flowctl**.

flowctl is available for:

- **Linux** x86-64. All distributions are supported.
- **MacOS** 11 (Big Sur) or later. Both Intel and M1 chips are supported.

To install, copy and paste the appropriate script below into your terminal. This will download flowctl, make it executable, and add it to your `PATH`.

- For Linux:

```console
sudo curl -o /usr/local/bin/flowctl -L 'https://github.com/estuary/flow/releases/latest/download/flowctl-x86_64-linux' && sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/flowctl
```

- For Mac:

```console
sudo curl -o /usr/local/bin/flowctl -L 'https://github.com/estuary/flow/releases/latest/download/flowctl-multiarch-macos' && sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/flowctl
```

Alternatively, Mac users can install with Homebrew:

```console
brew tap estuary/flowctl
brew install flowctl
```

flowctl isn't currently available for Windows.
For Windows users, we recommend running the Linux version inside [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/),
or using a remote development environment.

The flowctl source files are also on GitHub [here](https://go.estuary.dev/flowctl).

Once you've installed flowctl and are ready to begin working, authenticate your session using an access token.

1. Ensure that you have an Estuary account and have signed into the Flow web app before.

2. In the terminal of your local development environment, run:

   ```console
   flowctl auth login
   ```

   In a browser window, the web app opens to the CLI-API tab.

3. Copy the access token.

4. Return to the terminal, paste the access token, and press Enter.

The token will expire after a predetermined duration. Repeat this process to re-authenticate.

## Configuring your cloud storage bucket for use with Flow

During your trial period, Flow uses Estuary's cloud storage to temporarily store your data.
When you upgrade from a trial to an organizational account, you're provisioned a unique [prefix](../concepts/catalogs.md#namespace) in the Flow namespace,
and transition to using your own cloud storage bucket to store your Flow data. This is called a [storage mapping](../concepts/storage-mappings.md).

Flow supports Google Cloud Storage and Amazon S3 buckets.
Before your account manager configures your bucket as your storage mapping, you must grant access to Estuary.

### Google Cloud Storage buckets

Follow the steps to [add a principal to a bucket level policy](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/access-control/using-iam-permissions#bucket-add).

- For the principal, enter `flow-258@helpful-kingdom-273219.iam.gserviceaccount.com`
- Select the [`roles/storage.admin`](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/access-control/iam-roles) role.

### Amazon S3 buckets

:::info
Your S3 bucket must be in the us-east-1 [region](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/UsingBucket.html) for use with Flow.
:::

Follow the steps to [add a bucket policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/add-bucket-policy.html), pasting the policy below.
Be sure to replace `YOUR-S3-BUCKET` with the actual name of your bucket.

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "AllowUsersToAccessObjectsUnderPrefix",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::789740162118:user/flow-aws"
      },
      "Action": ["s3:GetObject", "s3:PutObject"],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::YOUR-S3-BUCKET/*"
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::789740162118:user/flow-aws"
      },
      "Action": "s3:ListBucket",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::YOUR-S3-BUCKET"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Azure Blob Storage

Setting up a Flow account to store data in your Azure Blob storage account requires you to grant our application access to your storage account and container, as well as providing us with some identifying information. At the moment storage mappings are not self-service, so once you have granted access and gathered the required information, reach out to your account manager who will configure your account.

#### Gathering information

In order to complete this process, you will need to gather the following data:

- Your **Azure AD tenant ID**. This can be found in the "Azure Active Directory" page here:
  ![](Azure_AD_Tenant_ID.png)
- Your **Azure Blob Storage account ID**. This can be found in the "Storage Accounts" page here:
  ![](Azure_Storage_Account_Name.png)
- Your **Azure Blob Storage container ID**. This can be found inside your storage account here:
  ![](Azure_Container_ID.png)

#### Granting Access

We use an [Azure Application](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/what-is-application-management) to allow granting access to storage resources between your tenant and ours. In order for Flow to write to your storage account, it needs the [`Storage Blob Data Owner`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#storage-blob-data-owner) IAM role for the storage account in question. In order to grant this role, you must first add our application to your tenant.

#### Add application to your tenant

import { AzureAuthorizeComponent } from "./azureAuthorize";
import BrowserOnly from "@docusaurus/BrowserOnly";

<BrowserOnly>{() => <AzureAuthorizeComponent />}</BrowserOnly>

#### Authorize application to your storage account

Once the application has been added, you must grant it the [`Storage Blob Data Owner`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#storage-blob-data-owner) IAM role for your storage account.

- Inside your storage account's "Access Control (IAM)" tab, click "Add Role Assignment"
- Search for the string `Storage Blob Data Owner` and select it
- On the next page, make sure `User, group, or service principal` is selected, then click "+ Select Members"
- You must search for the exact name of the application, otherwise it won't show up: `Estuary Storage Mappings Prod`
- Once you've selected the application, finish granting the role and you should be all set

### Give us a ring

Once you've finished the above steps, the next part is to contact us. Self-service storage mapping configuration is on our roadmap, but for the moment we're happy to configure your account by hand. Send support@estuary.dev an email containing all of the information you gathered above, as well as whether you want the storage mapping to apply to your whole Flow account, or just a subset of it. We'll get back to you letting you know when it's done, and that's it!

## Self-hosting Flow

The Flow runtime is available under the [Business Source License](https://github.com/estuary/flow/blob/master/LICENSE-BSL). It's possible to self-host Flow using a cloud provider of your choice.

:::caution Beta
Setup for self-hosting is not covered in this documentation, and full support is not guaranteed at this time.
We recommend using the [hosted version of Flow](#get-started-with-the-flow-web-application) for the best experience.
If you'd still like to self-host, refer to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/estuary/flow) or the [Estuary Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/estuary-dev/shared_invite/zt-86nal6yr-VPbv~YfZE9Q~6Zl~gmZdFQ).
