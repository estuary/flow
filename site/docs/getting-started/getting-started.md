# What is Estuary Flow?

Estuary Flow is a unified data movement and transformation platform for the whole data team.

Flow synchronizes your systems – SaaS, databases, streaming, and more – around the same datasets, which it stores in the
cloud and updates in milliseconds. It combines the easy cross-system integration of an ELT tool and a flexible streaming
backbone, all while remaining aware of your data's complete history.

<br />

A few examples of what you can do with Flow:

* Perform *change data capture* from MySQL tables into PostgreSQL or a cloud analytics warehouse like Snowflake or
  Databricks
* Capture and organize your data from your SaaS vendors (like Hubspot or Facebook), into an Apache Iceberg lakehouse
* Fetch, transform, and load logs from cloud delivery networks (CDNs) into Elasticsearch or BigQuery
* Hydrate real-time analytics systems such as Tinybird or StarTree
* Instrument real-time analytics over your business events, accessible from current tools like PostgreSQL or even Google
  Sheets

Under the hood, Flow comprises cloud-native streaming infrastructure, a powerful runtime for data processing,
and an open-source ecosystem of pluggable connectors for integrating your existing data systems.
