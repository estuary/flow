# Flow documentation

Estuary Flow is a tool for building, testing, and evolving pipelines that continuously capture, transform, and materialize data across all of your systems. It unifies today's batch and streaming paradigms so that your systems – current and future – are synchronized around the same data sets, updating in milliseconds. Use Flow to:

 * Perform *Change Data Capture* from MySQL tables into PostgreSQL, or a cloud analytics warehouse.
 * Fetch, transform, and load logs from Cloud Delivery Networks (CDNs) into Elastic Search or BigQuery.
 * Instrument real-time analytics over your business events, accessible from current tools like PostgreSQL or even Google Sheets.
 * Capture and organize your data from your SaaS vendors (like Salesforce or Facebook), into a Parquet Data Lake.

Flow composes cloud-native streaming infrastructure, a powerful runtime for data processing,
and an open-source ecosystem of pluggable connectors for integrating your existing systems.

### Quick start

**Wondering if Flow is right for you?**

If you're unsure if Flow is the right solution for your data integration needs, you can read about the technical benefits and clear comparisons with similar systems, from an engineering perspective.

* **[Who should use Flow?](overview/who-should-use-flow.md)**
* **[Comparisons with other systems](overview/comparisons.md)**

**Want to get up and running ASAP?**

Use the **Getting started** documentation to set up your development environment and run through tutorials designed to quickly teach you the most essential skills and concepts.

* **[Installation](getting-started/installation.md)**
* **[Tutorial Introduction](getting-started/flow-tutorials/)**

**Looking to understand the concepts behind Flow at a deeper level?**
