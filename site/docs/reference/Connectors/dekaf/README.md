# Dekaf integrations

[Dekaf](/guides/dekaf_reading_collections_from_kafka.md) is Estuary Flow's Kafka-API compatibility layer.
It allows services to read data from Estuary Flow's collections as if they were topics in a Kafka cluster. This
functionality enables integrations with the Kafka ecosystem.
