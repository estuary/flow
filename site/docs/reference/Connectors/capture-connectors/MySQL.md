This is a change data capture (CDC) connector that captures change events from a MySQL database via the [Binary Log](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/binary-log.html).

:::caution
This connector is still under development. Estuary does not currently guarantee
that it will behave as expected in all production environments.
:::

[`ghcr.io/estuary/source-mysql:dev`](https://github.com/estuary/connectors/pkgs/container/source-mysql) provides the latest connector image.
You can also follow the link in your browser to see past image versions.

## Prerequisites
To use this connector, you'll need a MySQL database setup with the following:
* [`binlog_row_metadata`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/replication-options-binary-log.html#sysvar_binlog_row_metadata)
  system variable set to `FULL`.
  - Note that this can be done on a dedicated replica even if the primary database has it set to `MINIMAL`.
* [Binary log expiration period](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/replication-options-binary-log.html#sysvar_binlog_expire_logs_seconds) of at at least seven days.
If possible, it's recommended to keep the default setting of 2592000 seconds (30 days).
* A watermarks table. The watermarks table is a small "scratch space"
  to which the connector occasionally writes a small amount of data (a UUID,
  specifically) to ensure accuracy when backfilling preexisting table contents.
  - The default name is `"flow.watermarks"`, but this can be overridden in `config.json`.
* A database user with appropriate permissions:
  - `REPLICATION CLIENT` and `REPLICATION SLAVE` privileges.
  - Permission to insert, update, and delete on the watermarks table.
  - Permission to read the tables being captured.
  - Permission to read from `information_schema` tables, if automatic discovery is used.

### Setup
To meet these requirements, do the following:

1. Create the watermarks table. This table can have any name and be in any database, so long as `config.json` is modified accordingly.
```sql
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS flow;
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS flow.watermarks (slot INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, watermark TEXT);
```
2. Create the `flow_capture` user with replication permission, the ability to read all tables, and the ability to read and write the watermarks table.

  The `SELECT` permission can be restricted to just the tables that need to be
  captured, but automatic discovery requires `information_schema` access as well.
```sql
CREATE USER IF NOT EXISTS flow_capture
  IDENTIFIED BY 'secret'
  COMMENT 'User account for Flow MySQL data capture';
GRANT REPLICATION CLIENT, REPLICATION SLAVE ON *.* TO 'flow_capture';
GRANT SELECT ON *.* TO 'flow_capture';
GRANT INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON flow.watermarks TO 'flow_capture';
```
3. Configure the binary log to record complete table metadata.
```sql
SET PERSIST binlog_row_metadata = 'FULL';
```
4. Configure the binary log to retain data for at least seven days, if previously set lower.
```sql
SET PERSIST binlog_expire_logs_seconds = 604800;
```

## Configuration
You configure connectors either in the Flow web app, or by directly editing the catalog spec YAML.
See [connectors](../../../concepts/connectors.md#using-connectors) to learn more about using connectors. The values and YAML sample below provide configuration details specific to the MySQL source connector.

### Properties

#### Endpoint

| Property | Title | Description | Type | Required/Default |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **`/address`** | Address | Database address in the format `host:port`. | string | Required, `"127.0.0.1:3306"` |

| `/watermarks_table` | Watermarks table | The name of the table used for watermark writes during backfills. Must be fully-qualified in `<schema>.<table>` form. | string | `"flow.watermarks"` |

#### Bindings

| Property | Title | Description | Type | Required/Default |
|-------|------|------|---------| --------|
| `/namespace` | Namespace | The [namespace](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/ha-memcached-using-namespaces.html) of the table, if used. | string | |

| **`/syncMode`** | Sync mode | Connection method. Always set to `incremental`. | string | Required |

### Sample
A minimal capture definition will look like the following:

```yaml
captures:
  ${TENANT}/${CAPTURE_NAME}:
    endpoint:
      connector:
        image: ghcr.io/estuary/source-mysql:dev
        config:
          address: "127.0.0.1:3306"
          dbname: "test"
          password: "secret"
          server_id: 12345
          user: "flow_capture"
          watermarks_table: "flow.watermarks"
    bindings:
      - resource:
          namespace: ${TABLE_NAMESPACE}
          stream: ${TABLE_NAME}
          syncMode: incremental
        target: ${TENANT}/${COLLECTION_NAME}

```
Your capture definition will likely be more complex, with additional bindings for each table in the source database.

## Connecting to secure networks

:::info beta
SSH tunneling on the MySQL source connector is actively being worked on and will be fully supported soon.
If you encounter issues with this feature, [contact Estuary support](mailto:support@estuary.dev).
:::

The MySQL source connector [supports SSH tunneling](../../../concepts/connectors.md#connecting-to-endpoints-on-secure-networks)
to allow Flow to connect to databases ports in secure networks.

To set up and configure your SSH server, see the [guide](../../../../guides/connect-network/).

## MySQL on managed cloud platforms

In addition to standard MySQL, this connector supports cloud-based MySQL instances on certain platforms.

### Amazon RDS

You can use this connector for MySQL instances on Amazon RDS using the following setup instructions.

Estuary recommends creating a [read replica](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/features/read-replicas/)
in RDS for use with Flow; however, it's not required.
You're able to apply the connector directly to the primary instance if you'd like.

#### Setup

1. You'll need to configure secure access to the database to enable the Flow capture.
  Estuary recommends SSH tunneling to allow this.
  Follow the guide to [configure an SSH server for tunneling](../../../../guides/connect-network/).
  :::info beta
  SSH tunneling on the MySQL source connector is actively being worked on and will be fully supported soon.

2. Create a RDS parameter group to enable replication in MySQL.

   1. [Create a parameter group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_WorkingWithDBInstanceParamGroups.html#USER_WorkingWithParamGroups.Creating).
   Create a unique name and description and set the following properties:
      * **Family**: mysql 8.0
      * **Type**: DB Parameter group

   2. [Modify the new parameter group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_WorkingWithDBInstanceParamGroups.html#USER_WorkingWithParamGroups.Modifying) and update the following parameters:
      * binlog_format: ROW
      * binlog_row_metadata: FULL
      * read_only: 0

   3. If using the primary instance  (not recommended), [associate the  parameter group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_WorkingWithDBInstanceParamGroups.html#USER_WorkingWithParamGroups.Associating)
   with the database and set [Backup Retention Period](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_WorkingWithAutomatedBackups.html#USER_WorkingWithAutomatedBackups.Enabling) to 7 days.
   Reboot the database to allow the changes to take effect.

3. Create a read replica with the new parameter group applied (recommended).

   1. [Create a read replica](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_ReadRepl.html#USER_ReadRepl.Create)
   of your MySQL database.

   2. [Modify the replica](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Overview.DBInstance.Modifying.html)
   and set the following:
      * **DB parameter group**: choose the parameter group you created previously
      * **Backup retention period**: 7 days

   3. Reboot the replica to allow the changes to take effect.

4. Switch to your MySQL client. Run the following commands to create a new user for the capture with appropriate permissions,
and set up the watermarks table:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS flow;
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS flow.watermarks (slot INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, watermark TEXT);
CREATE USER IF NOT EXISTS flow_capture
  IDENTIFIED BY 'secret'
  COMMENT 'User account for Flow MySQL data capture';
GRANT REPLICATION CLIENT, REPLICATION SLAVE ON *.* TO 'flow_capture';
GRANT SELECT ON *.* TO 'flow_capture';
GRANT INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON flow.watermarks TO 'flow_capture';
```

5. Run the following command to set the binary log retention to seven days:
```sql
CALL mysql.rds_set_configuration('binlog retention hours', 168);
```

### Google Cloud SQL

Google Cloud SQL doesn't currently support the setting `binlog_row_metadata: FULL`, which this connector requires.
As a result, this connector can't be used directly for MySQL instance on Google Cloud.

As an alternative, you can create a [read replica outside of Google cloud](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/replication#external-read-replicas).
The replica can be treated as a standard MySQL instance.

1. [Set up an external replica](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/replication/configure-external-replica).

2. Follow the [standard setup instructions](#setup) for this connector.

### Azure Database for MySQL

Azure Database for MySQL doesn't currently support the setting `binlog_row_metadata: FULL`, which this connector requires.
As a result, this connector can't be used for MySQL instance on Azure.

Contact your account manager or [Estuary support](mailto:support@estuary.dev) for help using a third-party connector.
Note that third party connectors will require you to [create a read replica](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/mysql/howto-read-replicas-portal).
