# Confluence

This connector captures data from Confluence into Flow collections via the Confluence [Cloud REST API](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/confluence/rest/v1/intro/#about).

It is available for use in the Flow web application. For local development or open-source workflows, [`ghcr.io/estuary/source-confluence:dev`](https://ghcr.io/estuary/source-confluence:dev) provides the latest version of the connector as a Docker image. You can also follow the link in your browser to see past image versions.

This connector is based on an open-source connector from a third party, with modifications for performance in the Flow system.
You can find their documentation [here](https://docs.airbyte.com/integrations/sources/confluence/),
but keep in mind that the two versions may be significantly different.

## Supported data resources

When you [configure the connector](#endpoint), you specify your email, api and domain name

From your selection, the following data resources are captured:

### resources

 - [Audit](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/confluence/rest/api-group-audit/#api-wiki-rest-api-audit-get)

Each resource is mapped to a Flow collection through a separate binding.
