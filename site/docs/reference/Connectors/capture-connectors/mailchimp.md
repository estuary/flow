# Mailchimp

This connector captures data from a Mailchimp account.

Three data resources are supported, each of which is mapped to a Flow collection: lists, campaigns, and email activity.

It is available for use in the Flow web application. For local development or open-source workflows, [`ghcr.io/estuary/source-mailchimp:dev`](https://ghcr.io/estuary/source-mailchimp:dev) provides the latest version of the connector as a Docker image. You can also follow the link in your browser to see past image versions.

This connector is based on an open-source connector from a third party, with modifications for performance in the Flow system.
You can find their documentation [here](https://docs.airbyte.com/integrations/sources/mailchimp),
but keep in mind that the two versions may be significantly different.

## Prerequisites

There are two ways to authenticate with MailChimp when capturing data: using OAuth2, and manually, with an API key.
Their prerequisites differ.

OAuth is recommended for simplicity in the Flow web app;
the API key method is the only supported method using the command line.

### Using OAuth2 to authenticate with Mailchimp in the Flow web app

* A Mailchimp account

### Configuring the connector specification manually

* A Mailchimp account

* A Mailchimp [API key](https://mailchimp.com/developer/marketing/guides/quick-start/#generate-your-api-key)

## Configuration

You configure connectors either in the Flow web app, or by directly editing the catalog specification file.
See [connectors](../../../concepts/connectors.md#using-connectors) to learn more about using connectors. The values and specification sample below provide configuration details specific to the Mailchimp source connector.
