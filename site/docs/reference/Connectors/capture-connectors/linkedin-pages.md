# LinkedIn Pages

This connector captures data from one LinkedIn Page into Flow collections via the [LinkedIn Marketing API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/marketing/integrations/marketing-integrations-overview?view=li-lms-2024-03).

This connector is based on an open-source connector from a third party, with modifications for performance in the Flow system.
You can find their documentation [here](https://docs.airbyte.com/integrations/sources/linkedin-pages), but keep in mind that the two versions may be significantly different.

## Prerequisites

* An existing LinkedIn Account

The API user account should be assigned the `ADMIN` role and the following permissions for the API endpoints.
Endpoints such as: `Organization Lookup API`, `Follower Statistics` and `Share Statistics` require these permissions:
- `r_organization_social`: Read the organization's posts, comments, reactions, etc.
- `rw_organization_admin`: Write and read the organization's pages and read reporting data.

### Authentication
This connector's authentication can be configured by either passing a LinkedIn access token or using Oauth to connect to your source. Oauth requires the additional setup of verifying your application with LinkedIn in order to use the required scopes.

You can see more details about the Community Management App Review in [LinkedIn's Docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/marketing/community-management-app-review?view=li-lms-2024-03).

:::info
LinkedIn access tokens expire in 60 days.
You must manually update your capture configuration to continue to capture data from LinkedIn.

Refresh tokens expire after 365 days from their creation date. If you receive a `401 invalid token response` error, it means that the access token has expired and you need to generate a new token. You can see more details about it in [LinkedIn's Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/shared/authentication/authorization-code-flow).

### Access Token Authentication

1. Go to the LinkedIn Developers' [OAuth Token Tools](https://www.linkedin.com/developers/tools/oauth) and click **Create token**

3. Click "Request access token" and save the token.

### Oauth Authentication

#### Create a LinkedIn OAuth App
1. Create a [LinkedIn Page](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a543852) if you don't have one.
2. [Create](https://www.linkedin.com/developers/apps/new) a developer application in LinkedIn's Developer Portal.
