# Braintree

This connector captures data from Braintree into Flow collections.

It is available for use in the Flow web application. For local development or open-source workflows, [`ghcr.io/estuary/source-braintree:dev`](https://ghcr.io/estuary/source-braintree:dev) provides the latest version of the connector as a Docker image. You can also follow the link in your browser to see past image versions.

This connector is based on an open-source connector from a third party, with modifications for performance in the Flow system.
You can find their documentation [here](https://docs.airbyte.com/integrations/sources/braintree/),
but keep in mind that the two versions may be significantly different.

## Supported data resources

The following data resources are supported through the Braintree APIs:

* [Customers](https://developer.paypal.com/braintree/docs/reference/request/customer/search)
* [Discounts](https://developer.paypal.com/braintree/docs/reference/response/discount)
* [Disputes](https://developer.paypal.com/braintree/docs/reference/request/dispute/search)
* [Transactions](https://developers.braintreepayments.com/reference/response/transaction/python)
* [Merchant Accounts](https://developer.paypal.com/braintree/docs/reference/response/merchant-account)
* [Plans](https://developer.paypal.com/braintree/docs/reference/response/plan)
* [Subscriptions](https://developer.paypal.com/braintree/docs/reference/response/subscription)

By default, each resource is mapped to a Flow collection through a separate binding.

## Prerequisites

To set up the Braintree source connector, you'll need Braintree's:

1. [Public Key](https://developer.paypal.com/braintree/articles/control-panel/important-gateway-credentials#public-key)
2. [Environment](https://developer.paypal.com/braintree/articles/control-panel/important-gateway-credentials#environment)
3. [Merchant ID](https://developer.paypal.com/braintree/articles/control-panel/important-gateway-credentials#merchant-id)
4. [Private Key](https://developer.paypal.com/braintree/articles/control-panel/important-gateway-credentials#private-key)

We recommend creating a restricted, read-only key specifically for Estuary access. This will allow you to control which resources Estuary should be able to access.

## Configuration

You configure connectors either in the Flow web app, or by directly editing the catalog specification file.
See [connectors](../../../concepts/connectors.md#using-connectors) to learn more about using connectors. The values and specification sample below provide configuration details specific to the Braintree source connector.
