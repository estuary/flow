# Datadog

This connector captures data from [Datadog](https://docs.datadoghq.com/api/latest) into Flow collections.

It is available for use in the Flow web application. For local development or open-source workflows, [`ghcr.io/estuary/source-datadog:dev`](https://ghcr.io/estuary/source-datadog:dev) provides the latest version of the connector as a Docker image. You can also follow the link in your browser to see past image versions.

## Supported data resources

The following data resources are supported through the Datadog API:

* [real_user_monitoring](https://docs.datadoghq.com/api/latest/rum)
* [logs](https://docs.datadoghq.com/api/latest/logs)

By default, each resource is mapped to a Flow collection through a separate binding.

## Prerequisites

* A Datadog account.
* A Datadog API key and Application key with the proper permissions:
    * `rum_apps_read` permission for RUM data
    * `logs_read_data` permission for logs data

    See Datadog's [documentation](https://docs.datadoghq.com/account_management/api-app-keys) for instructions on generating these credentials.

## Configuration

You configure connectors either in the Flow web app, or by directly editing the catalog specification files.
See [connectors](../../../concepts/connectors.md#using-connectors) to learn more about using connectors. The values and specification sample below provide configuration details specific to the Datadog source connector.
