# OracleDB (Flashback)
This connector captures data from OracleDB into Flow collections using Oracle Flashback.

It is available for use in the Flow web application. For local development or open-source workflows, ghcr.io/estuary/source-oracle-flashback:dev provides the latest version of the connector as a Docker image. You can also follow the link in your browser to see past image versions.

## Prerequisites
* Oracle 11g or above
* Allow connections from Estuary Flow to your Oracle database (if they exist in separate VPCs)
* Create a dedicated read-only Estuary Flow user with access to all tables needed for replication

## Setup
Follow the steps below to set up the OracleDB connector.

### Create a Dedicated User

Creating a dedicated database user with read-only access is recommended for better permission control and auditing.

1. To create the user, run the following commands against your database:

```sql
CREATE USER estuary_flow_user IDENTIFIED BY <your_password_here>;
GRANT CREATE SESSION TO estuary_flow_user;
```

2. Next, grant the user read-only access to the relevant tables. The simplest way is to grant read access to all tables in the schema as follows:

```sql
GRANT SELECT ANY TABLE TO estuary_flow_user;
```

3. Alternatively, you can be more granular and grant access to specific tables in different schemas:

```sql
GRANT SELECT ON "<schema_a>"."<table_1>" TO estuary_flow_user;
GRANT SELECT ON "<schema_b>"."<table_2>" TO estuary_flow_user;
```

4. Finally you need to grant the user access to read metadata from the database:

```sql
GRANT SELECT_CATALOG_ROLE TO estuary_flow_user;
```

5. Your database user should now be ready for use with Estuary Flow.

### Include Schemas for Discovery
In your Oracle configuration, you can specify the schemas that Flow should look at when discovering tables. The schema names are case-sensitive and will default to the upper-cased user if empty. If the user does not have access to the configured schemas, no tables will be discovered.

## Configuration
You configure connectors either in the Flow web app, or by directly editing the catalog specification file. See [connectors](https://docs.estuary.dev/concepts/connectors/#using-connectors) to learn more about using connectors. The values and specification sample below provide configuration details specific to the OracleDB Flashback source connector.

To allow secure connections via SSH tunneling:
  * Follow the guide to [configure an SSH server for tunneling](/guides/connect-network/)
  * When you configure your connector as described in the [configuration](#configuration) section above, including the additional `networkTunnel` configuration to enable the SSH tunnel. See [Connecting to endpoints on secure networks](/concepts/connectors.md#connecting-to-endpoints-on-secure-networks) for additional details and a sample.
