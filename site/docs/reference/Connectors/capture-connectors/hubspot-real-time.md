## Prerequisites

There are two ways to authenticate with HubSpot when capturing data: using OAuth2, or with a private app access token.
Their prerequisites differ.

OAuth is recommended for simplicity in the Flow web app;

### Using OAuth2 to authenticate with HubSpot in the Flow web app

* A HubSpot account

### Configuring the connector specification manually

* A HubSpot account

* The access token for an appropriately configured [private app](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/api/private-apps) on the Hubspot account.

#### Setup

To create a private app in HubSpot and generate its access token, do the following.

1. Ensure that your HubSpot user account has [super admin](https://knowledge.hubspot.com/settings/hubspot-user-permissions-guide#super-admin) privileges.

2. In HubSpot, create a [new private app](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/api/private-apps#create-a-private-app).

   1. Name the app "Estuary Flow," or choose another name that is memorable to you.

   2. Grant the new app **Read** access for all available scopes.

   3. Copy the access token for use in the connector configuration.

## Configuration

You configure connectors either in the Flow web app, or by directly editing the catalog specification file.
See [connectors](../../../concepts/connectors.md#using-connectors) to learn more about using connectors. The values and specification sample below provide configuration details specific to the HubSpot Real-Time connector.
