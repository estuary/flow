# Freshdesk

This connector captures Freshdesk data into Flow collections via the [Freshdesk API](https://developers.freshdesk.com/api/#introduction).

It is available for use in the Flow web application. For local development or open-source workflows, [`ghcr.io/estuary/source-freshdesk:dev`](https://ghcr.io/estuary/source-freshdesk:dev) provides the latest version of the connector as a Docker image. You can also follow the link in your browser to see past image versions.

This connector is based on an open-source connector from a third party, with modifications for performance in the Flow system.
You can find their documentation [here](https://docs.airbyte.com/integrations/sources/freshdesk/),
but keep in mind that the two versions may be significantly different.
