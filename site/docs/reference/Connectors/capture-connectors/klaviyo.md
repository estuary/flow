# Klaviyo

This connector captures data from Klaviyo into Flow collections.

It is available for use in the Flow web application. For local development or open-source workflows, [`ghcr.io/estuary/source-klaviyo:dev`](https://ghcr.io/estuary/source-klaviyo:dev) provides the latest version of the connector as a Docker image. You can also follow the link in your browser to see past image versions.

This connector is based on an open-source connector from a third party, with modifications for performance in the Flow system.

You can find their documentation [here](https://docs.airbyte.com/integrations/sources/klaviyo/),
but keep in mind that the two versions may be significantly different.

## Supported data resources

This connector can be used to sync the following tables from Klaviyo:

* [Campaigns](https://developers.klaviyo.com/en/v1-2/reference/get-campaigns#get-campaigns)
* [Events](https://developers.klaviyo.com/en/v1-2/reference/metrics-timeline)
* [GlobalExclusions](https://developers.klaviyo.com/en/v1-2/reference/get-global-exclusions)
* [Lists](https://developers.klaviyo.com/en/v1-2/reference/get-lists)
* [Metrics](https://developers.klaviyo.com/en/v1-2/reference/get-metrics)
* [Flows](https://developers.klaviyo.com/en/reference/get_flows)
* [Profiles](https://developers.klaviyo.com/en/reference/get_profiles)

By default, each resource is mapped to a Flow collection through a separate binding.

## Prerequisites

* To set up the Klaviyo source connector, you'll need the [Klaviyo Private API key](https://help.klaviyo.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005062267-How-to-Manage-Your-Account-s-API-Keys#your-private-api-keys3).
