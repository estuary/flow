# Paypal Transaction

This connector captures data from Paypal Transaction into Flow collections.

It is available for use in the Flow web application. For local development or open-source workflows, [`ghcr.io/estuary/source-paypal-transaction:dev`](https://ghcr.io/estuary/source-paypal-transaction:dev) provides the latest version of the connector as a Docker image. You can also follow the link in your browser to see past image versions.

This connector is based on an open-source connector from a third party, with modifications for performance in the Flow system.

You can find their documentation [here](https://docs.airbyte.com/integrations/sources/paypal-transaction/),
but keep in mind that the two versions may be significantly different.

## Supported data resources

The following data resources are supported through the Paypal APIs:

* [Transactions](https://developer.paypal.com/docs/api/transaction-search/v1/#transactions)
* [Balances](https://developer.paypal.com/docs/api/transaction-search/v1/#balances)

By default, each resource is mapped to a Flow collection through a separate binding.

## Prerequisites

* The [Paypal Transaction API](https://developer.paypal.com/docs/api/transaction-search/v1/) is used to get the history of transactions for a PayPal account.

## Configuration

You configure connectors either in the Flow web app, or by directly editing the catalog specification file.
See [connectors](../../../concepts/connectors.md#using-connectors) to learn more about using connectors. The values and specification sample below provide configuration details specific to the Paypal Transaction source connector.
