This connector captures data from [Apple App Store Connect API](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appstoreconnectapi) into Flow collections.

Itâ€™s available for use in the Flow web application. For local development or open-source workflows, [`ghcr.io/estuary/source-apple-app-store:dev`](https://ghcr.io/estuary/source-apple-app-store:dev) provides the latest version of the connector as a Docker image. You can also follow the link in your browser to see past image versions.

## Supported data resources

The following data resources are supported:

* [Customer Reviews for an App](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appstoreconnectapi/get-v1-apps-_id_-customerreviews)
* [Analytics Reports](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appstoreconnectapi/analytics)
  * [App Sessions Detailed Report](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/analytics-reports/app-sessions)
  * [App Crashes Report](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/analytics-reports/app-crashes)
  * [App Store Installations and Deletions Detailed Report](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/analytics-reports/app-installs)
  * [App Store Discovery and Engagement Detailed Report](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/analytics-reports/app-store-discovery-and-engagement)
  * [App Store Downloads Detailed Report](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/analytics-reports/app-download)


## Prerequisites

To use this connector, you'll need:

* An Apple Developer account with access to App Store Connect.
* App Store Connect API access approved by your Account Holder.
* An App Store Connect API key with Admin permissions (required for Analytics Reports).

## Authentication

An App Store Connect API key is required to authenticate the connector. The connector uses JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication with your private API key. To create an API key:

1. Sign in to [App Store Connect](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/)
2. Navigate to Users and Access > Integrations
3. Create a new API key with **Admin** permissions (required for Analytics Reports)
4. Download the private key (.p8 file) - this can only be done once
5. Note your Key ID and Issuer ID

Please refer to Apple's [official documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appstoreconnectapi/creating-api-keys-for-app-store-connect-api) for detailed steps on creating API keys.

:::info
Admin-level permissions are required to access Analytics Reports. Only Account Holders can initially request API access.
