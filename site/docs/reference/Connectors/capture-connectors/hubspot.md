# Hubspot

This connector captures data from a Hubspot account.

[`ghcr.io/estuary/airbyte-source-hubspot:dev`](https://ghcr.io/estuary/airbyte-source-hubspot:dev) provides the latest connector image. You can also follow the link in your browser to see past image versions.

This connector is based on an open-source connector from a third party, with modifications for performance in the Flow system.
You can find their documentation [here](https://docs.airbyte.com/integrations/sources/hubspot),
but keep in mind that the two versions may be significantly different.

## Prerequisites

There are two ways to authenticate with Hubspot when capturing data: using OAuth, and with an API key.
Their prerequisites differ.

OAuth is recommended for simplicity in the Flow web app;
the API key method is the only supported method using the command line.

### Prerequisites for OAuth

:::caution Beta
OAuth implementation is under active development and is coming soon.
Use the API key method for now.
:::

* A Hubspot account

### Prerequisites using an API key

* A Hubspot account

* A Hubspot [API key](https://knowledge.hubspot.com/integrations/how-do-i-get-my-hubspot-api-key)
