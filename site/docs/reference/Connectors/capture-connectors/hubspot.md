# Hubspot

This connector captures data from a Hubspot account.

Estuary offers a in-house real time version of this connector. For more information take a look at our [HubSpot Real-Time](/reference/Connectors/capture-connectors/hubspot-real-time.md) docs.

It is available for use in the Flow web application. For local development or open-source workflows, [`ghcr.io/estuary/source-hubspot:dev`](https://ghcr.io/estuary/source-hubspot:dev) provides the latest version of the connector as a Docker image. You can also follow the link in your browser to see past image versions.

This connector is based on an open-source connector from a third party, with modifications for performance in the Flow system.
You can find their documentation [here](https://docs.airbyte.com/integrations/sources/hubspot),
but keep in mind that the two versions may be significantly different.

## Prerequisites

There are two ways to authenticate with Hubspot when capturing data: using OAuth2 or with a private app access token.
Their prerequisites differ.

OAuth is recommended for simplicity in the Flow web app;
the access token method is the only supported method using the command line.

### Using OAuth2 to authenticate with Hubspot in the Flow web app

* A Hubspot account

### Configuring the connector specification manually

* A Hubspot account

* The access token for an appropriately configured [private app](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/api/private-apps) on the Hubspot account.

#### Setup

To create a private app in Hubspot and generate its access token, do the following.

1. Ensure that your Hubspot user account has [super admin](https://knowledge.hubspot.com/settings/hubspot-user-permissions-guide#super-admin) privileges.

2. In Hubspot, create a [new private app](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/api/private-apps#create-a-private-app).

   1. Name the app "Estuary Flow," or choose another name that is memorable to you.

   2. Grant the new app **Read** access for all available scopes.

   3. Copy the access token for use in the connector configuration.

## Configuration

You configure connectors either in the Flow web app, or by directly editing the catalog specification file.
See [connectors](../../../concepts/connectors.md#using-connectors) to learn more about using connectors. The values and specification sample below provide configuration details specific to the Hubspot source connector.

### Properties

#### Endpoint

The following properties reflect the access token authentication method.

|---|---|---|---|---|
| **`/credentials`** | Private Application | Authenticate with a private app access token | object | Required |
| **`/credentials/access_token`** | Access Token | HubSpot Access token. | string | Required |
| **`/credentials/credentials_title`** | Credentials | Name of the credentials set | string | Required, `"Private App Credentials"` |
| **`/start_date`** | Start Date | UTC date and time in the format 2017-01-25T00:00:00Z. Any data before this date will not be replicated. | string | Required |

#### Bindings

| Property | Title | Description | Type | Required/Default |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **`/stream`** | Data resource | Name of the data resource. | string | Required |
| **`/syncMode`** | Sync Mode | Connection method | string | Required |

### Sample

```yaml
captures:
  ${PREFIX}/${CAPTURE_NAME}:
    endpoint:
      connector:
        image: ghcr.io/estuary/source-hubspot:dev
          config:
            credentials:
              credentials_title: Private App Credentials
              access_token: <secret>
      bindings:
        - resource:
            stream: companies
            syncMode: incremental
          target: ${PREFIX}/${COLLECTION_NAME}
```
Your configuration will have many more bindings representing all supported [resources](#supported-data-resources)
in your Hubspot account.
