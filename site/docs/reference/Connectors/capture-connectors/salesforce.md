# Salesforce

This connector captures data from Salesforce objects into Flow collections.

Itâ€™s available for use in the Flow web application.
For local development or open-source workflows, [`ghcr.io/estuary/source-salesforce:dev`](https://ghcr.io/estuary/source-salesforce:dev) provides the latest connector image. You can also follow the link in your browser to see past image versions.

This connector is based on an open-source connector from a third party, with modifications for performance in the Flow system.
You can find their documentation [here](https://docs.airbyte.com/integrations/sources/salesforce/),
but keep in mind that the two versions may be significantly different.

## Supported data resources

This connector can capture the following Salesforce [standard objects](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.object_reference.meta/object_reference/sforce_api_objects_list.htm), if present in your account:

* Account
* Contact
* User
* OpportunityFilledHistory
* LeadHistory
* Opportunity
* Campaign
* Case
* ContactLineItem
* Entitlement
* Lead
* LiveChatTranscript
* MessagingSession
* Quote
* QuoteLineItem
* ServiceAppointment
* ServiceContract
* Task
* UserServicePresence
* WorkOrder
* WorkOrderLineItem

[Custom objects](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.dev_object_def.htm&type=5) aren't currently supported.
Each captured object is mapped to a Flow collection through a separate binding.

Because most Salesforce accounts contain large volumes of data, you may only want to capture a subset of the available objects.
There are several ways to control this:

* Create a [dedicated Salesforce user](#create-a-read-only-salesforce-user) with access only to the objects you'd like to capture.

* Apply a filter when you [configure](#endpoint) the connector. If you don't apply a filter, the connector captures all objects available to the user.

* During [capture creation in the web application](../../../guides/create-dataflow.md#create-a-capture),
remove the bindings for objects you don't want to capture.

## Prerequisites

### Using OAuth2 to authenticate with Salesforce in the Flow web app

If you're using the Flow web app, you'll be prompted to authenticate with Salesforce using OAuth. You'll need the following:

* A Salesforce organization on the Enterprise tier, or with an equivalent [API request allocation](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.salesforce_app_limits_cheatsheet.meta/salesforce_app_limits_cheatsheet/salesforce_app_limits_platform_api.htm).

* Salesforce user credentials. We recommend creating a dedicated read-only [Salesforce user](#create-a-read-only-salesforce-user).

### Configuring the connector specification manually

If you're working with flowctl and writing specifications in a local development environment,
you'll need to manually supply OAuth credentials. You'll need:

* The items required to [set up with OAuth2](#using-oauth2-to-authenticate-with-salesforce-in-the-flow-web-app).

* A Salesforce developer application with a generated client ID, client secret, and refresh token. [See setup steps.](#create-a-developer-application-and-generate-authorization-tokens)

### Setup

#### Create a read-only Salesforce user

Creating a dedicated read-only Salesforce user is a simple way to specify which objects Flow will capture.
This is useful if you have a large amount of data in your Salesforce organization.

1. While signed in as an administrator, create a [new profile](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.users_profiles_cloning.htm&type=5) by cloning the standard [Minimum Access](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.standard_profiles.htm&type=5) profile.

2. [Edit the new profile's permissions](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.perm_sets_object_perms_edit.htm&type=5). Grant it read access to all the standard and custom objects you'd like to capture with Flow.

3. [Create a new user](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.adding_new_users.htm&type=5), applying the profile you just created.
You'll use this user's email address and password to authenticate Salesforce in Flow.

#### Create a developer application and generate authorization tokens

To manually write a capture specification for Salesforce, you need to create and configure a developer application.
Through this process, you'll obtain the client ID, client secret, and refresh token.

1. Create a [new developer application](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.connected_app_create_api_integration.htm&type=5).

   a. When selecting **Scopes** for your app, select **Manage user data via APIs `(api)`**, **Perform requests at any time `(refresh_token, offline_access)`**, and **Manage user data via Web browsers `(web)`**.

2. Edit the app to ensure that **Permitted users** is set to [All users may self-authorize](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.connected_app_manage_oauth.htm&type=5).

3. Locate the [Consumer Key and Consumer Secret](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.remoteaccess_oauth_web_server_flow.htm&type=5). These are equivalent to the client id and client secret, respectively.

4. Follow the [Salesforce Web Server Flow](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.remoteaccess_oauth_web_server_flow.htm&type=5). The final POST response will include your refresh token.

## Configuration

You configure connectors either in the Flow web app, or by directly editing the Flow specification file.
See [connectors](../../../concepts/connectors.md#using-connectors) to learn more about using connectors. The values and specification sample below provide configuration details specific to the Salesforce source connector.

### Properties

#### Endpoint

The properties in the table below reflect the manual authentication method.
If you're working in the Flow web app, you'll use [OAuth2](#using-oauth2-to-authenticate-with-salesforce-in-the-flow-web-app),
so you won't need the `/credentials` values listed here.

| Property | Title | Description | Type | Required/Default |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **`/credentials`** |  |  | object | Required |
| `/credentials/auth_type` | Authorization type | Set to `Client` | string |  |
| **`/credentials/client_id`** | Client ID | The Salesforce Client ID, also known as a Consumer Key, for your developer application. | string | Required |
| **`/credentials/client_secret`** | Client Secret | The Salesforce Client Secret, also known as a Consumer Secret, for your developer application. | string | Required |
| **`/credentials/refresh_token`** | Refresh Token | The refresh token generated by your developer application. | string | Required |
| `/is_sandbox` | Sandbox | Whether you&#x27;re using a [Salesforce Sandbox](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.deploy_sandboxes_parent.htm&type=5). | boolean | `false` |
| `/start_date` | Start Date | Start date in the format YYYY-MM-DD. Data added on and after this date will be captured. If this field is blank, all data will be captured. | string |  |
| `/streams_criteria` | Filter Salesforce Objects (Optional) | Filter Salesforce objects for capture. | array |  |
| _`/streams_criteria/-/criteria`_ | Search criteria | Possible criteria are `"starts with"`, `"ends with"`, `"contains"`, `"exacts"`, `"starts not with"`, `"ends not with"`, `"not contains"`, and `"not exacts"`. | string | `"contains"` |
| _`/streams_criteria/-/value`_ | Search value | Search term used with the selected criterion to filter objects. | string |  |

#### Bindings

| Property | Title | Description | Type | Required/Default |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `/cursorField` | Cursor field | Field used as a cursor to track data replication; typically a timestamp field. | array, null |  |
| **`/stream`** | Stream | Salesforce object from which a collection is captured. | string | Required |
| **`/syncMode`** | Sync Mode | Connection method. | string | Required |
