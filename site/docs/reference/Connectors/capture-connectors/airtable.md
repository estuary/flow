# Airtable

This connector captures data from Airtable into Flow collections.

It is available for use in the Flow web application. For local development or open-source workflows, [`ghcr.io/estuary/source-airtable:dev`](https://ghcr.io/estuary/source-airtable:dev) provides the latest version of the connector as a Docker image. You can also follow the link in your browser to see past image versions.

This connector is based on an open-source connector from a third party, with modifications for performance in the Flow system.
You can find their documentation [here](https://docs.airbyte.com/integrations/sources/airtable/),
but keep in mind that the two versions may be significantly different.

## Prerequisites

* An active Airtable account

## Configuration

You configure connectors either in the Flow web app, or by directly editing the catalog specification file.
