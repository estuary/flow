# Marketo

This connector captures data from Marketo into Flow collections.

It is available for use in the Flow web application. For local development or open-source workflows, [`ghcr.io/estuary/source-marketo:dev`](https://ghcr.io/estuary/source-marketo:dev) provides the latest version of the connector as a Docker image. You can also follow the link in your browser to see past image versions.

This connector is based on an open-source connector from a third party, with modifications for performance in the Flow system.

You can find their documentation [here](https://docs.airbyte.com/integrations/sources/marketo/),
but keep in mind that the two versions may be significantly different.

## Supported data resources

This connector can be used to sync the following tables from Marketo:

* **activities\_X** where X is an activity type contains information about lead activities of the type X. For example, activities\_send\_email contains information about lead activities related to the activity type `send_email`. See the [Marketo docs](https://developers.marketo.com/rest-api/endpoint-reference/lead-database-endpoint-reference/#!/Activities/getLeadActivitiesUsingGET) for a detailed explanation of what each column means.
* **activity\_types.** Contains metadata about activity types. See the [Marketo docs](https://developers.marketo.com/rest-api/endpoint-reference/lead-database-endpoint-reference/#!/Activities/getAllActivityTypesUsingGET) for a detailed explanation of columns.
* **campaigns.** Contains info about your Marketo campaigns. [Marketo docs](https://developers.marketo.com/rest-api/endpoint-reference/lead-database-endpoint-reference/#!/Campaigns/getCampaignsUsingGET).
* **leads.** Contains info about your Marketo leads. [Marketo docs](https://developers.marketo.com/rest-api/endpoint-reference/lead-database-endpoint-reference/#!/Leads/getLeadByIdUsingGET).
* **lists.** Contains info about your Marketo static lists. [Marketo docs](https://developers.marketo.com/rest-api/endpoint-reference/lead-database-endpoint-reference/#!/Static_Lists/getListByIdUsingGET).
* **programs.** Contains info about your Marketo programs. [Marketo docs](https://developers.marketo.com/rest-api/endpoint-reference/asset-endpoint-reference/#!/Programs/browseProgramsUsingGET).

By default, each resource is mapped to a Flow collection through a separate binding.

## Prerequisites

* \(Optional\) Whitelist Estuary's IP address if needed

* A Marketo API Custom Service
* Marketo Client ID & Client Secret
