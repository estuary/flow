# Aircall

This connector captures data from Aircall into Flow collections.

It is available for use in the Flow web application. For local development or open-source workflows, ghcr.io/estuary/source-aircall:dev provides the latest version of the connector as a Docker image. You can also follow the link in your browser to see past image versions.

## Prerequisites
To set up the Aircall connector, you need the following prerequisite:

- Access Token: An access token acting as a bearer token is required for the connector to work. You can find the access token in the settings of [Aircall](https://dashboard.aircall.io/integrations/api-keys).

## Setup
Follow the steps below to set up the Aircall connector.

1. Obtain an Aircall access token from the Aircall [settings](https://dashboard.aircall.io/integrations/api-keys).

### Set up the Aircall connector in Estuary Flow
1. Log into your Estuary Flow account.
2. In the left navigation bar, click on "Captures". In the top-left corner, click "Connector Search".
3. Enter the name for the Aircall connector and select "Aircall" from the dropdown.
4. Fill out the following endpoint configurations:
   - `api_id`: The auto-generated ID.
   - `api_token`: The access token obtained from Aircall settings.
   - `start_date`: Date filter for eligible streams. Enter the desired start date.

## Configuration
You configure connectors either in the Flow web app, or by directly editing the catalog specification file. See [connectors](https://docs.estuary.dev/concepts/connectors/#using-connectors) to learn more about using connectors. The values and specification sample below provide configuration details specific to the Aircall source connector.

}
```

## Supported Streams
The Aircall connector supports the following streams:

- calls
- company
- contacts
- numbers
- tags
- user_availablity
- users
- teams
- webhooks

## API Method Example
An example of an API method call for Aircall:

`GET https://api.aircall.io/v1/numbers`


## Performance Considerations
The Aircall API currently uses v1. The connector defaults to using v1.
