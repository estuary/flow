# Microsoft SQL Server

This connector uses change data capture (CDC) to continuously capture updates in a Microsoft SQL Server database into one or more Flow collections.

It’s available for use in the Flow web application. For local development or open-source workflows, [`ghcr.io/estuary/source-sqlserver:dev`](https://ghcr.io/estuary/source-sqlserver:dev) provides the latest version of the connector as a Docker image. You can also follow the link in your browser to see past image versions.

## Supported versions and platforms

This connector will work on both hosted deployments and all major cloud providers.  It is designed for databases using any version of SQL Server which has CDC support, and is regularly tested against SQL Server 2017 and up.

Setup instructions are provided for the following platforms:

* [Self-hosted SQL Server](#self-hosted-sql-server)
* [Azure SQL Database](#azure-sql-database)
* [Amazon RDS for SQL Server](./amazon-rds-sqlserver/)
* [Google Cloud SQL for SQL Server](./google-cloud-sql-sqlserver/)

## Prerequisites

To capture change events from SQL Server tables using this connector, you need:

* For each table to be captured, a primary key should be specified in the database.
If a table doesn't have a primary key, you must manually specify a key in the associated Flow collection definition while creating the capture.
[See detailed steps](#specifying-flow-collection-keys).

* [CDC enabled](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/track-changes/enable-and-disable-change-data-capture-sql-server?view=sql-server-ver16)
on the database and the individual tables to be captured.
(This creates *change tables* in the database, from which the connector reads.)

* A **watermarks table**. The watermarks table is a small “scratch space” to which the connector occasionally writes a small amount of data to ensure accuracy when backfilling preexisting table contents.

* A user role with:
  * `SELECT` permissions on the CDC schema and the schemas that contain tables to be captured.
  * Access to the change tables created as part of the SQL Server CDC process.
  * `SELECT`, `INSERT`, and `UPDATE` permissions on the watermarks table

## Setup

To meet these requirements, follow the steps for your hosting type.

* [Self-hosted SQL Server](#self-hosted-sql-server)
* [Azure SQL Database](#azure-sql-database)
* [Amazon RDS for SQL Server](./amazon-rds-sqlserver/))
* [Google Cloud SQL for SQL Server](./google-cloud-sql-sqlserver/)

### Self-hosted SQL Server

1. Connect to the server and issue the following commands:

```sql
USE <database>;
-- Enable CDC for the database.
EXEC sys.sp_cdc_enable_db;
-- Create user and password for use with the connector.
CREATE LOGIN flow_capture WITH PASSWORD = 'secret';
CREATE USER flow_capture FOR LOGIN flow_capture;
-- Grant the user permissions on the CDC schema and schemas with data.
-- This assumes all tables to be captured are in the default schema, `dbo`.
-- Add similar queries for any other schemas that contain tables you want to capture.
GRANT SELECT ON SCHEMA :: dbo TO flow_capture;
GRANT SELECT ON SCHEMA :: cdc TO flow_capture;
-- Create the watermarks table and grant permissions.
CREATE TABLE dbo.flow_watermarks(slot INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, watermark TEXT);
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE ON dbo.flow_watermarks TO flow_capture;
-- Enable CDC on tables. The below query enables CDC the watermarks table ONLY.
-- You should add similar query for all other tables you intend to capture.
EXEC sys.sp_cdc_enable_table @source_schema = 'dbo', @source_name = 'flow_watermarks', @role_name = 'flow_capture';
```

2. Allow secure connection to Estuary Flow from your hosting environment. Either:
   * Set up an [SSH server for tunneling](/guides/connect-network/).

     When you fill out the [endpoint configuration](#endpoint),
     include the additional `networkTunnel` configuration to enable the SSH tunnel.
     See [Connecting to endpoints on secure networks](/concepts/connectors.md#connecting-to-endpoints-on-secure-networks)
     for additional details and a sample.

   * Whitelist the Estuary IP address, `34.121.207.128` in your firewall rules.

### Azure SQL Database

1. Allow connections between the database and Estuary Flow. There are two ways to do this: by granting direct access to Flow's IP or by creating an SSH tunnel.

   1. To allow direct access:
       * Create a new [firewall rule](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-sql/database/firewall-configure?view=azuresql#use-the-azure-portal-to-manage-server-level-ip-firewall-rules) that grants access to the IP address `34.121.207.128`.

   2. To allow secure connections via SSH tunneling:
       * Follow the guide to [configure an SSH server for tunneling](/guides/connect-network/)
       * When you configure your connector as described in the [configuration](#configuration) section above, including the additional `networkTunnel` configuration to enable the SSH tunnel. See [Connecting to endpoints on secure networks](/concepts/connectors.md#connecting-to-endpoints-on-secure-networks) for additional details and a sample.

2. In your SQL client, connect to your instance as the default `sqlserver` user and issue the following commands.

```sql
USE <database>;
-- Enable CDC for the database.
EXEC sys.sp_cdc_enable_db;
-- Create user and password for use with the connector.
CREATE LOGIN flow_capture WITH PASSWORD = 'secret';
CREATE USER flow_capture FOR LOGIN flow_capture;
-- Grant the user permissions on the CDC schema and schemas with data.
-- This assumes all tables to be captured are in the default schema, `dbo`.
-- Add similar queries for any other schemas that contain tables you want to capture.
GRANT SELECT ON SCHEMA :: dbo TO flow_capture;
GRANT SELECT ON SCHEMA :: cdc TO flow_capture;
-- Create the watermarks table and grant permissions.
CREATE TABLE dbo.flow_watermarks(slot INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, watermark TEXT);
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE ON dbo.flow_watermarks TO flow_capture;
-- Enable CDC on tables. The below query enables CDC the watermarks table ONLY.
-- You should add similar query for all other tables you intend to capture.
EXEC sys.sp_cdc_enable_table @source_schema = 'dbo', @source_name = 'flow_watermarks', @role_name = 'flow_capture';
```

3. Note the following important items for configuration:

   * Find the instance's host under Server Name. The port is always `1433`. Together, you'll use the host:port as the `address` property when you configure the connector.
   * Format `user` as `username@databasename`; for example, `flow_capture@myazuredb`.


## Configuration

You configure connectors either in the Flow web app, or by directly editing the catalog specification file.
See [connectors](/concepts/connectors.md#using-connectors) to learn more about using connectors. The values and specification sample below provide configuration details specific to the SQL Server source connector.

### Sample

```yaml
captures:
  ${PREFIX}/${CAPTURE_NAME}:
    endpoint:
      connector:
        image: "ghcr.io/estuary/source-sqlserver:dev"
        config:
          address: "<host>:1433"
          database: "my_db"
          user: "flow_capture"
          password: "secret"
    bindings:
      - resource:
          stream: ${TABLE_NAME}
          namespace: dbo
          primary_key: ["id"]
        target: ${PREFIX}/${COLLECTION_NAME}
```
Your capture definition will likely be more complex, with additional bindings for each table in the source database.

[Learn more about capture definitions.](/concepts/captures.md#pull-captures)

## Specifying Flow collection keys

Every Flow collection must have a [key](/concepts/collections.md#keys).
As long as your SQL Server tables have a primary key specified, the connector will set the
corresponding collection's key accordingly.

In cases where a SQL Server table you want to capture doesn't have a primary key,
you can manually add it to the collection definition during the [capture creation workflow](/guides/create-dataflow.md#create-a-capture).

1. After you input the endpoint configuration and click **Next**,
the tables in your database have been mapped to Flow collections.
Click each collection's **Specification** tab and identify a collection where `"key": [ ],` is empty.

2. Click inside the empty key value in the editor and input the name of column in the table to use as the key, formatted as a JSON pointer. For example `"key": ["/foo"],`

   Make sure the key field is required, not nullable, and of an [allowed type](/concepts/collections.md#schema-restrictions).
   Make any other necessary changes to the [collection specification](/concepts/collections.md#specification) to accommodate this.

3. Repeat with other missing collection keys, if necessary.

4. Save and publish the capture as usual.
