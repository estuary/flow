# Amazon RDS for SQL Server

This connector uses change data capture (CDC) to continuously capture updates in a Microsoft SQL Server database into one or more Flow collections.

Itâ€™s available for use in the Flow web application. For local development or open-source workflows, [`ghcr.io/estuary/source-sqlserver:dev`](https://ghcr.io/estuary/source-sqlserver:dev) provides the latest version of the connector as a Docker image. You can also follow the link in your browser to see past image versions.

## Supported versions and platforms

This connector designed for databases using any version of SQL Server which has CDC support, and is regularly tested against SQL Server 2017 and up.

## Prerequisites

To capture change events from SQL Server tables using this connector, you need:

- For each table to be captured, a primary key should be specified in the database.
  If a table doesn't have a primary key, you must manually specify a key in the associated Flow collection definition while creating the capture.
  [See detailed steps](#specifying-flow-collection-keys).

- [CDC enabled](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/track-changes/enable-and-disable-change-data-capture-sql-server?view=sql-server-ver16)
  on both the database and the individual tables to be captured.
  - Enabling CDC on a source table create a _change table_ in the database, from which the connector reads. You may optionally enable the "Automatic Capture Instance Management" advanced option to have the connector manage these automatically, but this will require additional permissions. See [Automatic Capture Instance Management](#automatic-capture-instance-management) for more details.

- A user role with:
  - `SELECT` permissions on the CDC schema and the schemas that contain tables to be captured.
  - Access to the change tables created as part of the SQL Server CDC process.
  - The `VIEW DATABASE STATE` or (in newer versions of SQL Server) `VIEW DATABASE PERFORMANCE STATE` permission.

## Setup

1. Allow connections between the database and Estuary Flow. There are two ways to do this: by granting direct access to Flow's IP or by creating an SSH tunnel.

   1. To allow direct access:

      - [Modify the database](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Overview.DBInstance.Modifying.html), setting **Public accessibility** to **Yes**.
      - Edit the VPC security group associated with your database, or create a new VPC security group and associate it with the database as described in [the Amazon documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Overview.RDSSecurityGroups.html#Overview.RDSSecurityGroups.Create). Create a new inbound rule and a new outbound rule that allow all traffic from the [Estuary Flow IP addresses](/reference/allow-ip-addresses).

   2. To allow secure connections via SSH tunneling:
      - Follow the guide to [configure an SSH server for tunneling](/guides/connect-network/)
      - When you configure your connector as described in the [configuration](#configuration) section above, including the additional `networkTunnel` configuration to enable the SSH tunnel. See [Connecting to endpoints on secure networks](/concepts/connectors.md#connecting-to-endpoints-on-secure-networks) for additional details and a sample.

2. In your SQL client, connect to your instance as the default `sqlserver` user and issue the following commands.

```sql
USE <database>;
-- Enable CDC for the database.
EXEC msdb.dbo.rds_cdc_enable_db;
-- Create user and password for use with the connector.
CREATE LOGIN flow_capture WITH PASSWORD = 'secret';
CREATE USER flow_capture FOR LOGIN flow_capture;
-- Grant the user permissions on the CDC schema and schemas with data.
-- This assumes all tables to be captured are in the default schema, `dbo`.
-- Add similar queries for any other schemas that contain tables you want to capture.
GRANT SELECT ON SCHEMA :: dbo TO flow_capture;
GRANT SELECT ON SCHEMA :: cdc TO flow_capture;
-- Grant the 'VIEW DATABASE STATE' permission.
GRANT VIEW DATABASE STATE TO flow_capture;
-- Enable CDC on tables. The below query enables CDC on table 'dbo.foobar',
-- you should add similar query for all other tables you intend to capture.
EXEC sys.sp_cdc_enable_table @source_schema = 'dbo', @source_name = 'foobar', @role_name = 'flow_capture';
```

6. In the [RDS console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/), note the instance's Endpoint and Port. You'll need these for the `address` property when you configure the connector.

### Handling DDL Alterations to Source Tables

In SQL Server, adding a column to the source table will not automatically cause it to be added to the CDC change table. Instead [Microsoft's recommended approach](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/track-changes/about-change-data-capture-sql-server?view=sql-server-ver17#handling-changes-to-source-table) is to create a second capture instance which reflects the new state of the source table, transition over to the new instance, and then delete the old one.

The connector will automatically detect the existence of a second capture instance and will seamlessly switch over to the newest one as soon as it reaches a point in the event stream where they are both valid. After this switchover occurs you may delete the old instance.

If you are managing capture instances manually, you will need to manually create the new instance with `sys.sp_cdc_enable_table`, wait for the new column to begin being captured, and then delete the old instance at your leisure using `sys.sp_cdc_disable_table`.

If you are using [Automatic Capture Instance Management](#automatic-capture-instance-management), the connector detect DDL alterations to the source table and will handle the whole process of creating a new CDC instance and dropping the old one automatically.

### Automatic Capture Instance Management

You may wish to have the connector automatically issue `sys.sp_cdc_enable_table` (and sometimes also `sys.sp_cdc_disable_table`) statements on your behalf. This can be done by enabling the option `Advanced > Automatic Capture Instance Management` and granting the required permission if necessary.

Unfortunately, the `sys.sp_cdc_enable_table` stored procedure [requires membership in the `db_owner` database role](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/system-stored-procedures/sys-sp-cdc-enable-table-transact-sql?view=sql-server-ver17#permissions) to call.

Granting that permission to the capture user is a hard requirement for using this feature, and can be done by executing `ALTER ROLE db_owner ADD MEMBER <user>` on the source database.

### Automatic Change Table Cleanup

By default, CDC change tables will retain change events for [three days](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/system-stored-procedures/sys-sp-cdc-add-job-transact-sql?view=sql-server-ver17#----retention). This can be modified via `sys.sp_cdc_change_job`, but a lower retention period can put you at a higher risk of losing change events in the event of downtime, if the issue persists long enough for unconsumed change events to expire. If this happens a complete backfill will be required to re-establish consistency.

An alternative solution is to enable the option `Advanced > Automatic Change Table Cleanup`. When this option is enabled, the connector will manually remove change events from the relevant change tables once it receives confirmation that they have been durably persisted into a Flow collection.

Unfortunately, the `sys.sp_cdc_cleanup_change_table` stored procedure used to delete CDC events from the change table [requires membership in the `db_owner` database role](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/system-stored-procedures/sys-sp-cdc-cleanup-change-table-transact-sql?view=sql-server-ver17#permissions) to call.

Granting that permission to the capture user is a hard requirement for using this feature, and can be done by executing `ALTER ROLE db_owner ADD MEMBER <user>` on the source database.

Note also that you still need to have enough free storage space to hold the full 3 days of CDC event retention in the worst case. Otherwise, in the event of downtime exceeding what you can store, you have only changed the failure mode to running out of disk space. This option is best used in situations where it is _possible_ to use that much storage but it is still undesirable for other reasons to use that much in normal operation, such as when using flexible storage volumes on a cloud host.

## Configuration

You configure connectors either in the Flow web app, or by directly editing the catalog specification file.
See [connectors](/concepts/connectors.md#using-connectors) to learn more about using connectors. The values and specification sample below provide configuration details specific to the SQL Server source connector.

```yaml
captures:
  ${PREFIX}/${CAPTURE_NAME}:
    endpoint:
      connector:
        image: "ghcr.io/estuary/source-sqlserver:dev"
        config:
          address: "<host>:1433"
          database: "my_db"
          user: "flow_capture"
          password: "secret"
    bindings:
      - resource:
          stream: ${TABLE_NAME}
          namespace: dbo
          primary_key: ["id"]
        target: ${PREFIX}/${COLLECTION_NAME}
```

Your capture definition will likely be more complex, with additional bindings for each table in the source database.

[Learn more about capture definitions.](/concepts/captures.md)

## Specifying Flow collection keys

Every Flow collection must have a [key](/concepts/collections.md#keys).
As long as your SQL Server tables have a primary key specified, the connector will set the
corresponding collection's key accordingly.

In cases where a SQL Server table you want to capture doesn't have a primary key,
you can manually add it to the collection definition during the [capture creation workflow](/guides/create-dataflow.md#create-a-capture).

1. After you input the endpoint configuration and click **Next**,
   the tables in your database have been mapped to Flow collections.
   Click each collection's **Specification** tab and identify a collection where `"key": [ ],` is empty.

2. Click inside the empty key value in the editor and input the name of column in the table to use as the key, formatted as a JSON pointer. For example `"key": ["/foo"],`

   Make sure the key field is required, not nullable, and of an [allowed type](/concepts/collections.md#schema-restrictions).
   Make any other necessary changes to the [collection specification](/concepts/collections.md#specification) to accommodate this.

3. Repeat with other missing collection keys, if necessary.

4. Save and publish the capture as usual.
