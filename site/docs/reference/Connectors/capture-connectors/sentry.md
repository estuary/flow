# Sentry

This connector captures data from Sentry into Flow collections.

It is available for use in the Flow web application. For local development or open-source workflows, [`ghcr.io/estuary/source-sentry:dev`](https://ghcr.io/estuary/source-sentry:dev) provides the latest version of the connector as a Docker image. You can also follow the link in your browser to see past image versions.

## Supported data resources

The following data resources are supported through the Sentry APIs:

- [Environments](https://docs.sentry.io/api/environments/list-an-organizations-environments/)
- [Teams](https://docs.sentry.io/api/teams/list-an-organizations-teams/)
- [Projects](https://docs.sentry.io/api/projects/list-your-projects/)
- [Issues](https://docs.sentry.io/api/events/list-a-projects-issues/)
- [Releases](https://docs.sentry.io/api/releases/list-an-organizations-releases/)

By default, each resource is mapped to a Flow collection through a separate binding.

## Prerequisites

To set up the Sentry source connector, you'll need a Sentry [auth token](https://docs.sentry.io/api/auth/#auth-tokens) and the [organization](https://docs.sentry.io/product/accounts/membership/) slug.

## Configuration

You configure connectors either in the Flow web app, or by directly editing the catalog specification files.
See [connectors](../../../concepts/connectors.md#using-connectors) to learn more about using connectors. The values and specification sample below provide configuration details specific to the Sentry source connector.
