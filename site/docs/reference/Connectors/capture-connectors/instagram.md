# Instagram

This connector captures data from Instagram into Flow collections.

This [Instagram article](https://help.instagram.com/570895513091465) talks about how to connect a Facebook page to your Instagram business account.

It is available for use in the Flow web application. For local development or open-source workflows, [`ghcr.io/estuary/source-instagram:dev`](https://ghcr.io/estuary/source-instagram:dev) provides the latest version of the connector as a Docker image. You can also follow the link in your browser to see past image versions.

This connector is based on an open-source connector from a third party, with modifications for performance in the Flow system.

You can find their documentation [here](https://docs.airbyte.com/integrations/sources/instagram/),
but keep in mind that the two versions may be significantly different.

## Supported data resources

The following data resources are supported through the Instagram APIs:
