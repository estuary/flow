# Firebolt

This Flow connector materializes [delta updates](../../../concepts/materialization.md#delta-updates) of Flow collections into Firebolt `FACT` or `DIMENSION` tables.

To interface between Flow and Firebolt, the connector uses Firebolt's method for [loading data](https://docs.firebolt.io/loading-data/loading-data.html):
First, it stores data as JSON documents in an S3 bucket.
It then references the S3 bucket to create a [Firebolt _external table_](https://docs.firebolt.io/loading-data/working-with-external-tables.html),
which acts as a SQL interface between the JSON documents and the destination table in Firebolt.

It is available for use in the Flow web application. For local development or open-source workflows, [`ghcr.io/estuary/materialize-firebolt:dev`](https://ghcr.io/estuary/materialize-firebolt:dev) provides the latest version of the connector as a Docker image. You can also follow the link in your browser to see past image versions.

## Prerequisites

To use this connector, you'll need:

* A Firebolt database with at least one [engine](https://docs.firebolt.io/working-with-engines/)
  * The engine must be started before creating the materialization.
  * It's important that the engine stays up throughout the lifetime of the materialization. To ensure this is the case, select Edit Engine on your engine. In the engine settings, set **Auto-stop engine after** to **Always On**.
* An S3 bucket where JSON documents will be stored prior to loading
  * The bucket must be in a [supported AWS region](https://docs.firebolt.io/general-reference/available-regions.html) matching your Firebolt database.
  * The bucket may be public, or may be accessible by an IAM user. To configure your IAM user, see the [steps below](#setup).
* At least one Flow [collection](../../../concepts/collections.md)

:::tip
 If you haven't yet captured your data from its external source,
 start at the beginning of the [guide to create a dataflow](../../../guides/create-dataflow.md).
 You'll be referred back to this connector-specific documentation at the appropriate steps.

### Setup

For non-public buckets, you'll need to configure access in AWS IAM.

1. Follow the [Firebolt documentation](https://docs.firebolt.io/loading-data/configuring-aws-role-to-access-amazon-s3.html) to set up an IAM policy and role, and add it to the external table definition.

2. Create a new [IAM user](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users_create.html#id_users_create_console). During setup:

   1. Choose **Programmatic** (access key) access. This ensures that an **access key ID** and **secret access key** are generated. You'll use these to configure the connector.

   2. On the **Permissions** page, choose **Attach existing policies directly** and attach the policy you created in step 1.

3. After creating the user, download the IAM credentials file.
Take note of the **access key ID** and **secret access key** and use them  to configure the connector.
See the [Amazon docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-sec-cred-types.html) if you lose your credentials.

## Configuration

To use this connector, begin with data in one or more Flow collections.
Use the below properties to configure a Firebolt materialization, which will direct Flow data to your desired Firebolt tables via an external table.

### Sample

```yaml
materializations:
  ${PREFIX}/${mat_name}:
	  endpoint:
        connector:
          config:
            database: my-db
            engine_url: my-db-my-engine-name.my-organization.us-east-1.app.firebolt.io
            password: secret
            # For public S3 buckets, only the bucket name is required
            s3_bucket: my-bucket
            username: firebolt-user
          # Path to the latest version of the connector, provided as a Docker image
          image: ghcr.io/estuary/materialize-firebolt:dev
	# If you have multiple collections you need to materialize, add a binding for each one
    # to ensure complete data flow-through
    bindings:
      - resource:
          table: table-name
          table_type: fact
      source: ${PREFIX}/${source_collection}
```

## Delta updates

Firebolt is an insert-only system; it doesn't support updates or deletes.
Because of this, the Firebolt connector operates only in [delta updates](../../../concepts/materialization.md#delta-updates) mode.
Firebolt stores all deltas — the unmerged collection documents — directly.

In some cases, this will affect how materialized views look in Firebolt compared to other systems that use standard updates.

## Reserved words

Firebolt has a list of reserved words, which my not be used in identifiers.
Collections with field names that include a reserved word will automatically be quoted as part of a Firebolt materialization.

|Reserved words| | |
|---|---|---|
| all |	false |	or |
| alter |	fetch |	order |
| and |	first |	outer |
| array |	float |	over |
| between |	from |	partition |
