# MongoDB

This connector materializes data from your Flow collections to your MongoDB collections.

[`ghcr.io/estuary/materialize-mongodb:dev`](https://ghcr.io/estuary/materialize-mongodb:dev) provides the latest connector image. You can also follow the link in your browser to see past image versions.

## Data model

MongoDB is a NoSQL database. Its [data
model](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/data-modeling-introduction/)
consists of **documents** (lightweight records that contain mappings of fields
and values) organized in **collections**. MongoDB documents have a mandatory
`_id` field that is used as the key of the collection.

## Prerequisites

You'll need:

* Credentials for connecting to your MongoDB instance and database.

* Read and write access to your MongoDB database and desired collections. See [Role-Based Access
  Control](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/authorization/) for more information.

* If you are using MongoDB Atlas, or your MongoDB provider requires whitelisting
  of IPs, you need to whitelist Estuary's IP: `34.121.207.128`.

## Configuration

You configure connectors either in the Flow web app, or by directly editing the Flow specification file.
See [connectors](../../../concepts/connectors.md#using-connectors) to learn more about using connectors. The values and specification sample below provide configuration details specific to the Firestore source connector.

### Sample

```yaml
materializations:
  ${PREFIX}/${CAPTURE_NAME}:
    endpoint:
      connector:
        image: ghcr.io/estuary/materialize-mongodb:dev
        config:
          address: "mongo:27017"
          database: "test"
          password: "flow"
          user: "flow"
    bindings:
      - resource:
          collection: users
          database: test
        source: ${PREFIX}/users
```

## SSH Tunneling

As an alternative to connecting to your MongoDB instance directly, you can allow secure connections via SSH tunneling. To do so:

1. Refer to the [guide](../../../../guides/connect-network/) to configure an SSH server on the cloud platform of your choice.

2. Configure your connector as described in the [configuration](#configuration) section above, with the addition of the `networkTunnel` stanza to enable the SSH tunnel, if using. See [Connecting to endpoints on secure networks](../../../concepts/connectors.md#connecting-to-endpoints-on-secure-networks) for additional details and a sample.

## Delta updates

This connector supports both standard (merge) and [delta updates](../../../concepts/materialization.md#delta-updates).
The default is to use standard updates.
