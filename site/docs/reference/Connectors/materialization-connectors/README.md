# Materialization connectors

Estuary's available materialization connectors are listed in this section. Each connector has a unique set of requirements for configuration; these are linked below the connector name.

Also listed are links to the most recent Docker images for each connector. You'll need these to write Flow specifications manually (if you're [developing locally](../../../concepts/flowctl.md)). If you're using the Flow web app, they aren't necessary.

Estuary is actively developing new connectors, so check back regularly for the latest additions. We’re prioritizing the development of high-scale technological systems, as well as client needs.

At this time, all the available materialization connectors are created by Estuary.
In the future, other open-source materialization connectors from third parties could be supported.
