This Flow connector materializes [delta updates](../../../concepts/materialization.md#delta-updates) of your Flow collections into Rockset collections.

It is available for use in the Flow web application. For local development or open-source workflows, [`ghcr.io/estuary/materialize-rockset:dev`](https://github.com/estuary/connectors/pkgs/container/materialize-rockset) provides the latest version of the connector as a Docker image. You can also follow the link in your browser to see past image versions.

## Prerequisites

To use this connector, you'll need:

* A Rockset account with an [API key generated](https://rockset.com/docs/rest-api/#createapikey) from the web UI
* A Rockset workspace
    * Optional; if none exist, one will be created by the connector.
* A Rockset collection
    * Optional; if none exist, one will be created by the connector.
* At least one Flow collection

## Configuration

To use this connector, begin with data in one or more Flow collections.
Use the below properties to configure a Rockset materialization, which will direct one or more of your Flow collections to your desired Rockset collections.

### Properties

#### Endpoint

| Property | Title | Description | Type | Required/Default |
|-------|------|------|---------| --------|
| **`/api_key`** | API key | The key used to authenticate to the Rockset API. | String | Required |


#### Bindings

The binding configuration for this connector includes two optional sections.
**Backfill from S3** allows you to backfill historical data from an S3 bucket, [as detailed below](#bulk-ingestion-for-large-backfills-of-historical-data).
**Advanced collection settings** includes settings that may help optimize your resulting Rockset collections:

* **Clustering fields**: You can specify clustering fields
for your Rockset collection's columnar index to help optimize specific query patterns.
See the [Rockset docs](https://rockset.com/docs/query-composition/#data-clustering) for more information.
* **Event time field**: All Rockset documents have an associated `_event_time` field,
which is created for each collection.
You can specify an existing integer or timestamp field in your data to be used for `_event_time`.
See the [Rockset docs](https://rockset.com/docs/special-fields/#the-_event_time-field) for more information.
* **Insert only**: Disallows updates and deletes. The materialization will fail if there are documents with duplicate keys, but indexing in Rockset will be more efficient.
* **Retention period**: Amount of time before data is purged, in seconds.
A low value will keep the amount of data indexed in Rockset smaller.

### Sample

```yaml
materializations:
  ${PREFIX}/${mat_name}:
	  endpoint:
  	  connector:
    	    config:
               api_key: supersecret
            # Path to the latest version of the connector, provided as a Docker image
    	    image: ghcr.io/estuary/materialize-rockset:dev
	# If you have multiple collections you need to materialize, add a binding for each one
    # to ensure complete data flow-through

    source: ${PREFIX}/${source_collection}
```

## Delta updates and reduction strategies

The Rockset connector operates only in [delta updates](../../../concepts/materialization.md#delta-updates) mode.
This means that Rockset, rather than Flow, performs the document merge.
In some cases, this will affect how materialized views look in Rockset compared to other systems that use standard updates.

Rockset merges documents by the key defined in the Flow collection schema, and always uses the semantics of [RFC 7396 - JSON merge](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7396).
This differs from how Flow would reduce documents, most notably in that Rockset will _not_ honor any reduction strategies defined in your Flow schema.
For consistent output of a given collection across Rockset and other materialization endpoints, it's important that that collection's reduction annotations
in Flow mirror Rockset's semantics.

To accomplish this, ensure that your collection schema has the following [data reductions](../../../concepts/schemas.md#reductions) defined in its schema:

* A top-level reduction strategy of [merge](../../reduction-strategies/merge.md)
* A strategy of [lastWriteWins](../../reduction-strategies/firstwritewins-and-lastwritewins.md) for all nested values (this is the default)


## Bulk ingestion for large backfills of historical data

You can backfill large amounts of historical data into Rockset using a *bulk ingestion*. Bulk ingestion must originate in S3 and requires additional steps in your dataflow.
This workflow is supported using the [flowctl](../../../concepts/flowctl.md) CLI.

### Prerequisites

Before completing this workflow, make sure you have:
* A working catalog spec including at least one Flow collection.
* A production or [development](../../../getting-started/installation.md) environment
:::tip
The following is an intermediate workflow. As needed, refer to [this guide](../../../guides/create-dataflow.md) for the basic steps to create and deploy a catalog spec using the GitOps workflow.

### How to perform a bulk ingestion

A bulk ingestion from a Flow collection into Rockset is essentially a two-step process. First, Flow writes your historical data into an S3 bucket using Estuary's [S3-Parquet materialization](https://github.com/estuary/connectors/pkgs/container/materialize-s3-parquet) connector. Once the data is caught up, it uses the Rockset connector to backfill the data from S3 into Rockset and then switches to the Rockset Write API for the continuous materialization of new data.

import Mermaid from '@theme/Mermaid';

<Mermaid chart={`
	graph TD
    A[Create an S3 integration in Rockset] --> B
    B[Create Flow materialization into S3 bucket] --> C
    C[Wait for S3 materialization to catch up with historical data] -->|When ready to bulk ingest into Rockset| D
    D[Disable S3 materialization shards] --> E
    E[Update same materialization to use the Rockset connector with the integration created in first step] --> F
    F[Rockset connector automatically continues materializing after the bulk ingestion completes]
`}/>

To set this up, use the following procedure as a guide, substituting `example/flow/collection` for your collection:

1. You'll need an [S3 integration](https://rockset.com/docs/amazon-s3/) in Rockset. To create one, follow the [instructions here](https://rockset.com/docs/amazon-s3/#create-an-s3-integration), but _do not create the Rockset collection yet_.
2. Create and activate a materialization of `example/flow/collection` into a unique prefix within an S3 bucket of your choosing.
  ```yaml
  materializations:
    example/toRockset:
      endpoint:
        connector:
          image: ghcr.io/estuary/materialize-s3-parquet:dev
          config:
            bucket: example-s3-bucket
            region: us-east-1
            awsAccessKeyId: <your key>
            awsSecretAccessKey: <your secret>
            uploadIntervalInSeconds: 300
      bindings:
        - resource:
            pathPrefix: example/s3-prefix/
          source: example/flow/collection
  ```
3. Once the  S3 materialization is caught up with your historical data, you'll switch to the Rockset write API for your future data. To make the switch, first disable the S3 materialization by setting shards to disabled in the definition, and re-deploy the catalog. This is necessary to ensure correct ordering of documents written to Rockset.
  ```yaml
  materializations:
    example/toRockset:
      shards:
        disable: true
      # ...the remainder of the materialization yaml remains the same as above
  ```
4. Update the materialization to use the `materialize-rockset` connector, and re-enable the shards. Here you'll provide the name of the Rockset S3 integration you created above, as well as the bucket and prefix that you previously materialized into. **It's critical that the name of the materialization remains the same as it was for materializing into S3.**
  ```yaml
  materializations:
    example/toRockset:
      endpoint:
        connector:
          image: ghcr.io/estuary/materialize-rockset:dev
          config:
            api_key: <your rockset API key here>
      bindings:
        - resource:
            workspace: <your rockset workspace name>
            collection: <your rockset collection name>
            initializeFromS3:
              integration: <rockset integration name>
              bucket: example-s3-bucket
              region: us-east-1
              prefix: example/s3-prefix/
          source: example/flow/collection
  ```
5. When you activate the new materialization, the connector will create the Rockset collection using the given integration, and wait for it to ingest all of the historical data from S3 before it continues. Once this completes, the Rockset connector will automatically switch over to the incoming stream of new data.
