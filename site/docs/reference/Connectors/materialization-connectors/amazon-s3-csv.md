# CSV Files in Amazon S3

This connector materializes [delta updates](/concepts/materialization/#delta-updates) of
Flow collections into files in an S3 bucket per the CSV format described in
[RFC-4180](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4180.html). The CSV files are compressed using Gzip
compression.

The delta updates are batched within Flow, converted to CSV files, and then pushed to the S3 bucket
at a time interval that you set. Files are limited to a configurable maximum size. Each materialized
Flow collection will produce many separate files.

[`ghcr.io/estuary/materialize-s3-csv:dev`](https://ghcr.io/estuary/materialize-s3-csv:dev) provides
the latest connector image. You can also follow the link in your browser to see past image versions.

## Prerequisites

To use this connector, you'll need:

* An S3 bucket to write files to. See [this
  guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/create-bucket-overview.html) for
  instructions on setting up a new S3 bucket.
* An AWS root, IAM user or role with the
  [`s3:PutObject`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_PutObject.html) permission
  for the S3 bucket.

  When authenticating as user, you'll need the **access key** and **secret access key**. See the
  [AWS blog](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/wheres-my-secret-access-key/) for help finding
  these credentials.  When authenticating using a role, you'll need the **region** and the **role
  arn**.  Follow the steps in the [AWS IAM guide](/guides/iam-auth/aws.md) to setup the role.


## Configuration

Use the below properties to configure the materialization, which will direct one or more of your
Flow collections to your bucket.

| **`/path`** | Path  | The path that objects will be materialized to. | string | Required         |

### Sample

```yaml
materializations:
  ${PREFIX}/${mat_name}:
    endpoint:
      connector:
        image: "ghcr.io/estuary/materialize-s3-csv:dev"
        config:
          bucket: bucket
          awsAccessKeyId: <access_key_id>
          awsSecretAccessKey: <secret_access_key>
          region: us-east-2
          uploadInterval: 5m
    bindings:
      - resource:
          path: ${COLLECTION_NAME}
        source: ${PREFIX}/${COLLECTION_NAME}
```

## File Names

Materialized files are named with monotonically increasing integer values, padded with leading 0's
so they remain lexically sortable. For example, a set of files may be materialized like this for a
given collection:

```
bucket/prefix/path/v0000000000/00000000000000000000.csv
bucket/prefix/path/v0000000000/00000000000000000001.csv
bucket/prefix/path/v0000000000/00000000000000000002.csv
```

Here the values for **bucket** and **prefix** are from your endpoint configuration. The **path** is
specific to the binding configuration. **v0000000000** represents the current **backfill counter**
for binding and will be increased if the binding is re-backfilled, along with the file names
starting back over from 0.

## Eventual Consistency

In rare circumstances, recently materialized files may be re-written by files with the same name if
the materialization shard is interrupted in the middle of processing a Flow transaction and the
transaction must be re-started. Files that were committed as part of a completed transaction will
never be re-written. In this way, eventually all collection data will be written to files
effectively-once, although inconsistencies are possible when accessing the most recently written
data.
