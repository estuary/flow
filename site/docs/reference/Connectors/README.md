# Connectors

A current list and configuration details for Estuary's connectors can be found on the following pages:
* [Capture connectors](./capture-connectors/)
* [Materialization connectors](./materialization-connectors/)

[Many additional connectors are available from Airbyte](https://airbyte.io/connectors). They function similarly but are limited to batch workflows, which Flow will run at a regular and configurable cadence.

You can learn more about how connectors work and how to use them in their [conceptual documentation](../../concepts/connectors.md).
