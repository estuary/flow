## Placeholder - to rewrite

Intro to connectors here.For conceptual overview, see the [conceptual docs](../../concepts/connectors.md)

In the pages that follow, each connector that Estuary built and maintains is documented, including:
* Prerequisite items and setup steps
* Configuration details

Information on third-party connectors can be found on Airbyte's site [here](https://docs.airbyte.io/integrations).
