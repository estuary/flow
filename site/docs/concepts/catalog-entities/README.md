# Catalogs

A **catalog** is a collection of configurations that defines your entire Flow workflow. Catalogs tell Flow how to obtain, process, and persist data by defining various entities that Flow understands. These include [captures](captures.md), [collections](collections.md), [derivations](derivations/), [materializations](materialization.md), and [schemas](schemas-and-data-reductions.md).&#x20;

The various pages in this documentation section discuss the details behind each of these key entities, as well as other important concepts that help the catalog run.

Large businesses can have thousands of separate data products, and Flow is designed with this in mind. Flow can manage catalogs of any size and has sufficient flexibility to enable collaboration, even in the largest organizations.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
We assume you already have a basic knowledge of Flow, so if you haven't already, begin learning about Flow by following the[ tutorial](../../getting-started/flow-tutorials/hello-flow.md) and reading the [high-level concepts](../README.md) page.

Alternatively, if you need information on the specific options and programming elements, see the [catalog entities reference section](../../reference/catalog-reference/) instead.
