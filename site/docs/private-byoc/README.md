# Private and BYOC Deployments

This section provides additional information and guides to help set up [private](../getting-started/deployment-options.md#private-deployment) and [Bring Your Own Cloud](../getting-started/deployment-options.md#byoc-bring-your-own-cloud) deployments.

These deployment options let you use Estuary Flow with your own cloud environment and are especially suited to industries with a strict regulatory landscape.

[Contact us](mailto:support@estuary.dev) to begin the process for a private or BYOC deployment. You will need a license to get started.
