## What is a Plan?

Plans are living documents that provide a roadmap for current and past projects. They contain:
- an executive summary
- background
- requirements
- relevant codebase types and functions, with brief details
- architecture and diagrams
- implementation plans, notes, and status

Plans are targeted to expert developers and omit excessive background.

Format: GitHub Markdown with structured lists, bullets, links, progress checklists, and Mermaid diagrams.
See [TEMPLATE.md](TEMPLATE.md). Plans live in the [plans](plans) directory.

## Why Plans?

* Provide shared structure and context for humans and AI agents
* Serve as historical artifacts for future reference

## Plan Lifecycle

- Plans are written by developers and AI agents.
- Plans are sometimes reviewed in PRs by stakeholders
- Plans are kept "evergreen", and are updated as design and implementation progresses
- Checklists track implementation and testing progress
